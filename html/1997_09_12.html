         [ Hi. Danny here - or "Starchild" as I am now known. Since
         my life-changing experience at Burning Man, the
</span><span class="quote">         "Californian Glastonbury Without Any Decent Music", I am
         much more interested in constructing large sculptures of
         transgendered aliens from Playa mud than reporting in a
         hoity-toity voice the latest technology news. At least, for
         now. But hell, you can make do with yet another MiniNTK, 
         can't you? Can't you?]


               "Since the tragic news concerning the death of Diana,
         Princess of Wales, many of you have contacted us to ask how
                        the event will be affected at the weekend...
           There will be no change to opening times... the show will
                                         be going ahead as planned."

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV &gt;&gt; schedules seem to be returning to normal now, though
         VR5 (11.15pm, Fri, BBC2) is still rubbish, and it's a tough
         call between Sam "Evil Dead" Raimi's bizarrely under-par
         Coen-brothers collaboration CRIMEWAVE (12.55am, Fri, BBC1)
         and Jackie Chan's cheerily incoherent POLICE STORY II
         (12.35am, Fri, C4)... one reason why GLADIATORS (6.15pm,
         Sat, LWT) had to be cancelled last Sat is, apparently, that
         one of the contestants is an undertaker and the commentator
         keeps making gags about coffins (ditto for BLIND DATE,
         immediately after?)... Jimmy "Cracker" McGovern's THE LAKES
         (9.05pm, Sun, BBC1) purports to be a Brit Twin Peaks, but
         almost certainly isn't, though it does have a romance
         between two actors most famous for their phone ads: John
         "Cellnet" Simm and Emma "No, I want to talk to you, Dad"
         Cunniffe... EQUINOX (9pm, Mon, C4) reckons Britain could
         have nuked the Yanks and taken over the world if only we'd
         been a bit prompter with our grant applications... the
         SEINFELD/LARRY SANDERS double bill (11.15pm, Tue, BBC2)
         gets off to a shaky start, and, come on BBC2! - why only
         once a week?... the world's best video diary show is
         deservedly repeated AS SEEN ON TV (6.45pm, Wed, BBC2 -
         after Star Trek: TNG)... on the other hand, Steven "Press
         Gang" Moffat's teacher sitcom CHALK (10.15pm, Wed, BBC1),
         tries hard, could do better. See me..

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES &gt;&gt; 187 (imdb: "drama") - as <a href="http://www.policescanner.com">www.policescanner.com</a>
         fans will know - is a police code for "homicide", and also
         an interesting (if confused) school-gang movie from Kevin
         "Prince Of Thieves/Waterworld" Reynolds... probably a mild
         improvement on elderly Harrison Ford's patchwork Die-Hard-
         on-a-plane antics in AIR FORCE ONE (imdb: "thriller /
         action / aviation / terrorism / president / refueling"),
         whose best feature is that, whenever anyone says the title,
         you can come straight back with "Stirling Albion: Nil"...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MAGS &gt;&gt; FRANK is apparently just like all other women's
         magazines, but "with a bit of New Labour" thrown in...
         COVER MAGAZINE (due next week) claims to summarise all the
         month's papers in one handy volume, which presumably keeps
         them much too busy to have a website... current 21C (like
         Mondo 2000, but with the design under control) has good bit
         by Mark Dery on brand tatoos (in accordance with prophecy -
         search NTK archive for "tattoo")... the current issue of
         GOOD HOUSEKEEPING asks "Do You Have *That Certain
         Something*?", implying a feature inside that attempts the
         logical paradox of *defining* "je ne sais quoi"...

         Brutish and Short', not 'Nasty, British and Short'. I
         couldn't bare to lose the lovely 'brutish'.

         for any concerned readers, is Steve's original mail:

</span><span class="item">         "I also want to point out that, while I think it's
         perfectly OK for you to say 'Nasty, British and Short, you
         should understand that we at the wholly-unlamented Tired
         <a href="http://www.tired.co.uk/">http://www.tired.co.uk/</a> ('soon' to be re-launched) said
         'Weekly, Brutish and Short' months ago. Can you put a
         little form at the web site for people to post their own
         variants on 'nasty, brutish and short'? Then we could get
         it in the back of one of the Sunday Supplements."

</span><span class="item">         Q. OK then, why is "MiniNTK" now often substantially longer
         than "NTK Classic"?

</span><span class="item">         A.Aha, we're not called "Britain's Most Sarcastic Weekly
         Tech Newsletter" for nothing. Though obviously it would
         be even more ironically appropriate *if we were*.

</span><span class="item">         Q. Joke's over guys. When is the *real* NTK coming
         back?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A. Two weeks. We promise. Two weeks. Keep holding on in
         there...

</span><span class="smallprint">      Need To Know is a useful and interesting UK digest of things that
        happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
      on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
    nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
   It is registered at the Post Office as "not going to mention her again".
