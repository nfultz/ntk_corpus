</span><span class="item">         TRUE NAMES was a great story, but it did get some things
         wrong about the future. For one thing, in our universe
         naming systems and truth seem mutually exclusive. Take, for
         instance, .NAME - the TLD which, in some weird meta-manner,
         allowed people to reserve their real names online - like
         craig.shergold.name. The supervising NIC (whose name, in
         another meta twist, is Dot Name) were very determined .names
         could only be sold to their bona fide eponymous purchasers.
         Second-level domains were completely off limits, so no
         madonna.name. Strange to say, these cumbersome .name's didn't
         sell so well, so Dot Name has now switched to selling the
         second-level domains, like (hitler.name, say) to anyone who
         asks. And so as the market in one restrictive TLD collapses,
         the traditional liberal TLDs seem to be getting crankier:
         the NIC of CX just suspended Internet institution GOATSE.CX,
         ripping that site a new a-hole for painfully breaching its
         terms and conditions. It's not often you hear of a domain
         registrar suspending a domain for being beyond taste and
         decency. Especially not .cx, whose registration database NTK
         had the pleasure of sharing a box with back in its more
         carefree days. Believe us, goatse.cx may not have been the
         prettiest, but it was certainly one of the more demurely
         named .cx domains. I wonder if all those sex sites will be
         suspended too?

         geeks at Oxford have announced that they're porting the
         Creative Commons license to UK law. We're not sure exactly
         what this involves (short of globally searching and
         replacing "fair use" with "fair dealing") and what it all
         means - does this mean CC'd stuff isn't really free under UK
         law? What about the GPL? Have we been pirating Mr Stallman's
         good work all this time? Will any new EUCD laws
         criminalising commercial copyright infringement compel the
         police to lock up anyone downloading gcc? IANAL, natch.

         Harry telling off some young whippersnappers who shoot 
         criminals before he can get to them with his MAGNUM FORCE 
         (9.05pm, Sat, C5) - followed by high-school scifi action in 
         bodysnatcher homage THE FACULTY (11pm, Sat, BBC1) plus dire 
         videogame adaptation WING COMMANDER (12.40am, Sat, BBC1)... 
         Robert Carlyle shows up in the overrated TRAINSPOTTING 
         (10.30pm, Sun, C4) and uneven cannibal prequel RAVENOUS 
         (11.45pm, Sat, BBC2)... yet not even the patron saint of 
         adolescent gross-out, Seann William Scott, can salvage the 
         frankly indefensible DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR? (9pm, Sun, C4)... 
         Bill Paxton season goes from MIGHTY JOE YOUNG (5.55pm, Sun, 
         C5) to A SIMPLE PLAN (11.15pm, Mon, BBC1)... Chris O'Donnell 
         night includes BATMAN FOREVER (8pm, Sun, C5) and SCENT OF A 
         WOMAN (11.15pm, Sun, ITV)... but both combine in the climactic 
         rock-climbing nonsense VERTICAL LIMIT (8pm, Thu, C5)... THIS 
         WORLD: FOOTBALL AND FREEDOM (9pm, Sun, BBC2) is a South 
         African soccer remake of basketball docu "Hoop Dreams"... a 
         less upbeat view of sport is explored in the original ultra-
         violent ROLLERBALL (12midnight, Sun, BBC1)... and SCAMBUSTERS 
         (8pm, Wed, BBC1) tackles Canadian lottery "wins" and - tee-
         hee! - maybe replies to 419 Nigerians?... HORIZON (9pm, Thu, 
         BBC2) catches up with this hot new "Atkins diet"... it's Kevin 
         Warwick vs Jeremy Clarkson in THE COMPUTER: INVENTIONS THAT 
         CHANGED THE WORLD (8pm, Thu, BBC2)... while Larry "M*A*S*H" 
         Gelbart wrote star-studded above-average made-for-TV media 
         satire WEAPONS OF MASS DISTRACTION (12.20am, Thu, BBC1)...
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; it's all "12A", all the time this week, with John Woo

         PAYCHECK ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/paycheck.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/paycheck.htm</a> : 
         technology espionage/piracy; excessive [Uma Thurman] cleavage; 
         dress threatening to expose the pubic hair line; recklessness 
         in traffic, repeatedly, once narrowly avoiding being hit by a 
         bus)... better than "Waiting for Guffman", but no "Spinal Tap" 
         or "Best In Show", harmonises folk music mockumentary A MIGHTY 
         WIND ( <a href="http://www.screenit.com/movies/2003/a_mighty_wind.html">http://www.screenit.com/movies/2003/a_mighty_wind.html</a> :
         A PR woman shows some cleavage; [Catherine O'Hara's] husband 
         has built a miniature railroad town that includes a brothel 
         that he points out - we see a small, doll figure through the 
         window that's supposed to represent a prostitute)... or - 
         together at last - it's "professional videogamer" John Cusack, 
         Gene Hackman, Dustin Hoffman, Rachel Weisz and Jennifer 
         "Flashdance" Beals in John Grisham courtroom caper RUNAWAY 
         JURY ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/runawayjury.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/runawayjury.htm</a> : 
         definitely written by anti-gun activists and by folks who 
         clearly support government control of the people; guns, 
         bananas, cars and pillows don't kill people. People kill 
         people; advocates of abolishing guns were portrayed as law-
         abiding, responsible, intelligent and mature citizens)... 
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         RED BOOK AUDIO&gt;&gt; so is it just us, or does the Kill Bill 
         trailer music (as heard in 2003's best bootleg, Hotei Tomoyasu 
         Vs Eminem: <a href="http://www.jonnyboyrevel.co.uk/pages/disc.htm">http://www.jonnyboyrevel.co.uk/pages/disc.htm</a> ) 
         sound almost exactly like the theme from "Thundercats"? And 
         while we're at it: The Prodigy's "Smack My Bitch Up" - isn't 
         that the same drum pattern that then appears on "Remind Me" by 
         Royksopp: <a href="http://www.ntk.net/2004/01/16/SmackMyRoyksOpp.mp3">http://www.ntk.net/2004/01/16/SmackMyRoyksOpp.mp3</a> ?
         (1.8 meg mp3, also contains 5-to-the-floor bonus beats of 
         "Holst: The Planets" vs "Mission: Impossible"). Still, some 
         soundalikes do have their up side - reader ANDREW MORLEY 
         suggested his own ingenious solution to the "corrupt CD" 
         controversy <a href="http://ukcdr.org/issues/cd/bad/#uk">http://ukcdr.org/issues/cd/bad/#uk</a> , with this tip 
         for those trying to bypass the copy protection on the new Dido 
         album, "Life For Rent": "Don't bother", Andrew succinctly 
         advises. "Simply rip the previous Dido CD again - it sounds 
         exactly the same"... in more original compositions: we appear 
         to be risking all-out interci-ian annihilation by printing the 
         name of contributor IAN MILLER name for the second time in 4 
         years <a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=01999-04-09&amp;l=288#l">http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=01999-04-09&amp;l=288#l</a> , but 
         his link to this clumsily housed-up general-MIDI TV-theme was 
         worth it: <a href="http://www.ljkruzer.co.uk/mp3/">http://www.ljkruzer.co.uk/mp3/</a> . JIM JARMO humbly 
         alerted us to his own "cack-handedly-produced" (his words, not 
         ours) techno-filks at <a href="http://www.headpaste.com/">http://www.headpaste.com/</a> (imagine an 
         inexplicably well-spoken Mike "The Streets" Skinner), while 
         Guardian "Bad Science" correspondent DR BEN GOLDACRE thought 
         we might enjoy Death By Chocolate's "The Land Of Chocolate": 
         <a href="http://www.jetsetrecords.com/mp3s/death_by_chocolate/choc.mp3">http://www.jetsetrecords.com/mp3s/death_by_chocolate/choc.mp3</a>
         - entirely correctly, as it turned out... which just leaves the 
         matter of advert soundalikes, with the Wilkinson Sword Quatro 
         TV campaign resembling The Violent Femmes' "Blister In The 
         Sun" so closely that we're almost embarrassed to mention it. 
         Still, following the Guardian Guide's speculation that all of 
         Evanescence's songs (but especially "Bring Me To Life") sound 
         like they've been written specifically to accompany sanitary 
         protection ads - plus the recent use of use of Belinda 
         Carlisle's "Heaven Is A Place On Earth" to promote Haven 
         holiday camps (surely "Devon Is A Place On Earth" would be 
         more appropriate?) - you're also invited to suggest other 
         songs that would be "just right" for TV ads (and not just 
         those for the South-West of England). To start off, how about 
         Busted's debut single with just a minor lyrical modification: 
         "(That's) What I Go To Poole For"...
