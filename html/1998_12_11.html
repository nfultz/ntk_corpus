</span><span class="item">         More CRYPTO idiocy, as the UK government continues to
         prepare its new E-commerce law... to ... oh, for God's sake,
         what's the use? We're *so* preaching to the converted here.
         *You* know how dumb these proposed restrictions on strong
         crypto are. You've clocked that, unchecked, the government
         is going to stuff e-commerce, stomp on civil liberties, and
         catch exactly zero numbers of drug barons and kiddy
         pornsters. But what can you do? The only people with any
         influence on this issue are MPs. And they're so ignorant
         about tech that even if you did tell them that we'd built a
         postcode-to-constituency database grepped from public domain
         sources, and linked that (using a Web subscription system)
         to a low-traffic mailing list and a standard fax engine and
         a plugin that serves customised GIFS of every MP in the
         country, so that you can "adopt" your local MP, and put an
         adoption certificate on your Webpage, and then with a simple
         e-mail in a few weeks let your local MP learn that this
         issue *is* important, local people *do* care, and if she
         doesn't do something about it, thousands of people (all
         with monstrous levels of IQ and technological nous) are
         going to kick up such a fuss that they'd wish they'd banned
         the Internet when they'd had the chance - you know, I don't
         think they'd understand a word you were saying. Fortunately,
         they will - once you've finished with them. Welcome to
         WWW.STAND.ORG.UK, a site that let's you be lazy, geeky *and*

</span><span class="item">         So now we've sloughed our sneering apathy and become
         crusading activists, we *must* remind you all to strike for
         fixed-rate local calls this Sunday, as the successful
         German/Spanish cyberstrike attempts to take fire over here.
         Unfortunately, even our pals at THE CAMPAIGN FOR UNMETERED
         COMMUNICATIONS think this Sunday's action a little...
         premature (proletariat still suffering from false
         consciousness, illiterate advocacy spammed to uk.* newsgroups in
         HTML, BT actively not giving a fig, etc.) Perhaps a better
         way to show your support for a flat rate would be to take
         *full* advantage of BT's 50p per national call (no time
         limit) offer on Christmas Day and January 1st. Offer only
         available for "geographical" STDs (no credits for 0645,
         0845, etc), so check the national numbers for your ISP. Come
         on - who'd be calling you on Christmas Day anyway?

</span><span class="item">         Wow, it's already worked! BRITISH TELECOM announced a
         fixed-price permanent connection for anyone using ISDN in
         London this week. Using the always-on ISDN D-channel, the
         upgrade to BT's system allows a constant 2400 baud stream.
         [actually, it's 2.4Kbps. Ignore subsequent sarcasm - d.]
         That means you could run a mailserver at home, or even get
         your ISP to signal you when an incoming packet is received,
         letting you "wake up" your home machine, and access it
         remotely. Well, you *could*, if BT had wanted it like that.
         The D-channel is built into the ISDN spec, so the cost to BT
         is vanishingly small. As you'd expect, the altruistic
         corporation has passed on that benefit to ISPs, who will
         have to pay around 400UKP per annum, per line. And it won't
         be available for Home Highway users. And that's for a whole
         2400 baud, remember!

         reminisce on last week's CONSPIRACY HACKER CONFERENCE. It
         was, attendees must agree, a positively Edwardian affair. In
         a delightful gentleman's apartment above Manchester's
         fashional Tapas Tapas bar, restaurant and wrestling pit,
         young larval types listened wide-eyed to tales of masonic
         control, as their elders leant on nearby consoles, in
         spirited recitation of seasonal exploits. After port,
         cigars, and the obligatory bust-by-cops/
         row-with-mafioso-landlords, revellers moved through to a
         stately council home in Manchester's Mosside district,
         enjoying on the way the cheerful banter of the helpful
         cabbies, unruffled by the 3am pavement appearance of an
         entire intranet, with support staff. And so, as dawn
         beckons, and the youngsters gather to steal electricity from
         a dead telephone socket to drive a acoustic coupler they've
         gaffer-taped to a mobile phone, so we must bid our
         farewells, and ask, in the morning chill: can the UK
         underground truly be dead? And if so, does that mean all the
         charges are dropped?

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; the long-latent gay subtext surfaces in a particularly
         erudite FRASIER (10pm, Fri, C4), effectively apologising for
         the hour-long London indulgence of FRIENDS (9pm, Fri, C4)...
         but could even Steve Martin's cut-up classic DEAD MEN DON'T
         WEAR PLAID (12.05am, Fri, BBC1) make up for Ridley Scott's
         cod-feminist blockbuster THELMA AND LOUISE (9.30pm, Fri,
         BBC1)?... BBC2 follows its previous zany theme evenings with
         the rather more sobering HUMAN RIGHTS NIGHT (from 7.05pm,
         Sat, BBC2), featuring trailer tongue-twister Daniel
         Day-Lewis in IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER (9.30pm, Sat, BBC2),
         and a look at more local violations in PEOPLE VS UK
         (11.25pm, Sun, BBC2) - hopefully to feature that old Ross
         Anderson chestnut "If the Allies had lost WW2, the
         Dambusters missions would have been tried as war crimes"...
         flagrant abuses continue meanwhile on ITV with the dual
         torture of Steve Guttenberg's POLICE ACADEMY (12.05am, Sat,
         ITV) rubbed into the still-raw wounds inflicted by THE
         BRITISH COMEDY AWARDS (9pm, Sat, ITV)... and a chance to
         re-record the mysteriously worn title sequence on your video
         of cheerfully stupid Pamela Anderson Casablanca remake BARB
         WIRE (10.15pm, Sun, C4)... PANORAMA (10pm, Mon, BBC1)
         unwittingly explores the psychological need of surviving
         relatives to find "explanations" for unexpected suicides...
         Jonathan Demme makes amends for the gay serial killer in
         Silence Of The Lambs with Tom Hanks disease-of-the-week
         weepie PHILADELPHIA (9pm, Mon, ITV)... and Carol Vorderman,
         the richest woman in British showbiz, is evidently qualified
         to help viewers FIND A FORTUNE (8pm, Wed, ITV)... SCIENCE AT
         WAR (9.25pm, Thu, BBC2) concludes with a promising look at
         "Full Spectrum Dominance" - robot planes, smart bombs, big
         lasers, and infowar... and SEX AND SHOPPING (10.50pm, Thu,
         C5) now seems to be taking a more consumer tack, this week
         comparing gay porn from the US and UK - presumably on
         criteria like camerawork, value for money, and so forth...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; noisy trailer doesn't convey the comedy in good
         old-fashioned swashbuckling romp THE MASK OF ZORRO (imdb:
         epic / father-daughter / gold / hacienda / heroine / horses
         / mask / mexico / murder / period / revenge / slave-labor /
         superhero / swashbuckler / swordfight / teacher-student /
         tragedy / zorro / bandits / brothers / california / church /
         confessional / defenestration). Hey, the script has to be
         spectacular to coax decent performances from Antonio
         Banderas and Catherine Zeta "Grey" Jones, here playing a
         19th century Bond girl, in not too much of an imaginative
         stretch for director Martin "Edge Of Darkness / Goldeneye"
         Campbell... thinking of getting divorced? Create unrealistic
         hopes of parental reconciliation by taking your kids to
         well-made transatlantic family feelgooder THE PARENT TRAP
         (MPAA rated: PG "for some mild mischief"). And what is it
         with those Richardson girls (Natasha here, Joely in 101
         Dalmations) and recent Disney remakes?... rather grimmer
         limited release action, with Toni "Muriel's Wedding"
         Collette living unhappily ever after in gritty post-heist
         containment drama play-adaptation THE BOYS (imdb:
         Australian)... and Mulder gets high on his own supply in
         neo-noir David Duchovny vehicle PLAYING GOD (imdb: medical)
         - no info yet available on freeze-frames of Angelina
         "Hackers" Jolie...

         FERROUS PARTICLES' DAY OFF (WITH YOUR HOST, DAVID COVERDISC,
</span><span class="geekmedia">         OF "WHITESNAKE")&gt;&gt; big win time for those of us who've put
         off buying CDs all year in the hope that the good tracks
         always get given away free on Xmas magazines. For UKP3 or
         less, these free gifts - or "unprotected MP3 source files",
         as we prefer to think of them - also make ideal Christmas
         presents (bin the mags, obviously; they're terrible), and
         you can even use the weird rubbery glue they stick them on
         with as fake bogies... WOMAN AND HOME (UKP1.90) is the
         cheapest, but their covermount cassette "Christmas Music
         1998" delivers just "A 30-minute selection of *glorious
         carols* and *classical music*" (their emphasis): Joy To The
         World, Good King Wenceslas, Silent Night and a rousing
         accappella I Saw Three Ships... Q MAGAZINE's self-effacing
         "The Best Tracks From The Best Albums Of 1998" (UKP2.80) is
         no less mainstream, with only Marylin Manson breaching the
         peace of Air, Catatonia, Madonna, Fatboy Slim, Massive
         Attack and REM singles, and inoffensive album tracks from
         the Manics, The Beautiful South. But where, oh where, are Q
         indispensables Paul Weller and Ocean Colour Scene?...
         higher hopes dashed slightly by UNCUT's foolhardily titled
         "Unconditionally Guaranteed: The Coolest Sounds From The
         Hottest Bands Of 1998" (UKP2.85), largely featuring Brit
         bands trying to sound American (eg Silversun perfecting
         their impersonation of the Foo Fighters), and vice-versa...
         and further disappointments from NEON's "15 Great Tracks
         From" (UKP2.60). From where? From forgettable soundtracks
         like A Life Less Ordinary, Mojo, Scream 2, and - of course -
         Velvet Goldmine. Fluke at last do a track that doesn't sound
         like Atom Bomb, unfortunately it doesn't sound very good
         either... MUZIK's "1998: The Tunes" (UKP2.60) covers a
         broad church of dancefloor fillers - Freestylers to speed
         garage - but doesn't quite match the cool cost-effective
         moogy knob-twiddling of the "All Back To Ours Exclusive Mix
         By Jacques Lu Cont" on last week's MELODY MAKER (UKP0.95)...
         ultimate party album? Either the refreshingly honest "All
         The Stuff You Know You'll Dance To When You're Drunk"
         (LIVING ETC, UKP2.40) - cacophonous High Energy start
         mellows to respectable versions of '60s/'70s faves: Sam &amp;
         Dave's Soul Man, Gloria Gaynor's Never Can Say Goodbye, a
         non-recent Midnight At The Oasis... or similarly
         retro-flavoured "Classic Movie Themes 2" off the current
         TOTAL FILM (UKP2.40). Some odd choices - 7 mins of
         Braveheart? And that's not "Empire Strikes Back", it's Star
         Wars Imperial March! - but enough instrumental Titanic,
         Kraftwerk-esque Clockwork Orange, and comedy Dambusters
         march to get everyone re-enacting their favourite scenes,
         'specially when you can stomp around to the closing 4 mins
         36 of The Terminator...
