</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A hushed public awaits: and, in the pages of Time magazine,
         Bill Gates puts THE CASE FOR MICROSOFT. But years of
         conviction play with a man's recollection. Every every one
         of Bill's arguments points to the company's guiltiest
         moments. With a split Microsoft, he begins, a future MS
         "tablet PC" with handwriting recognition would not exist,
         because Microsoft's OS and App developers need "real-time
         collaboration" to pull it off.  But MS had designs on a
         "tablet PC" before: when they wrote Pen Windows, a
         piece of FUDware designed to kill Jerry Kaplan's GO.
         Back then, Microsoft bristled at any suggestion that their
         OS and App departments colluded. Now the party line is that
         it's vital for the consumer. In 1991, Gates goes on to
         explain, MS Office developers invented the toolbar. "Had
         toolbars been created elsewhere, they no doubt would have
         been patented and never incorporated into Windows [as the
         taskbar]". How very true: except toolbars *were* invented
         elsewhere. In MacPaint. In 1984. At that point, Gates
         entered into a secret agreement with Apple to use
         Mac-ish features in the Windows OS, in return for developing
         apps for the Mac (no monopoly here: yet). Moving to modern
         day concerns: Bill says that the DOJ scheme would slow down
         innovation, impeding "Windows updates that could protect
         against attacks like the Love Bug virus". As opposed to now,
         when Microsoft denies liability for the jelly-weak security
         of Outlook? Gates end with his own horrific vision,
         post-Microsplit: Apps and OS mini-Bills that could never
         work together, because the DOJ demands that "no technical
         information can be discussed that is not 'simultaneously
         available' to the entire computer industry - which would be
         a practical impossibility". An impossibility, of course,
         which open source projects - and hell, most of the rest of
         the industry - manage every day.  Except, that is, when
         Microsoft sues for publishing MS's proprietary extensions to
         their work. And this is the case *for*?

</span><span class="item">         More ILOVEYOU anthems: The DERBY EVENING TELEGRAPH reports
         that the Tory leader of Derby City Council was sent a
         mysterious fax, containing the secret code of the virus. The
         police recommend that she send them a copy for forensic
         study, then destroy it: demonstrating that it still had
         destructive viral properties, even in this weakened form.
         Similarly, the Guardian gave a clue to the Nam-Shub nature
         of the attachment when they revealed it was written in
         "Virtual Basic".  When the alleged creator was caught - as
         prophesied, in the Philippines, his sinister black-ice
         powers served to hide his trail.  Scrambled news reporters
         variously listed his name as Reomel Ramones, Rommel
         Lamores, Rommel Lamore, Rommel Ramores, Riomel Lamores,
         Reomel Ramones, and Reonel Rameon. And the mutations
         are increasing at an exponential rate.

         cyber cafe machines?  Sure, you're using ssh - no problems,
         right?  You'll be glad to know some of the more frustrating
         compatibility snafus with ssh may be going away now that the
         knights of OpenSSH have wrestled the ssh2 protocol away from
         the dark side.  So, that's the network sorted - but what
         about those pesky local key-loggers? Well, for on-the-road
         access we'll packing a PDA with OPIE, an open replacement
         for Bellcore's (apparently abandoned) One Time Password S/KEY
         system. With support for OTP in openssh we'll soon be able
         to sit back, sipping our overpriced lattes, worrying about
         some of the more obscure vunerabilites.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; tough call for fans of Smack The Pony's Sarah
         Alexander, as she appears simultaneously in Steven "Press
         Gang" Moffat's sniggering sex-com COUPLING (9.30pm, Fri
         (ahem); 10.50pm, Sat, BBC2), hopefully to feature loads more
         contrived set-ups with mobiles and answerphones...  not
         wishing to overload the cybernetic circuits, the hotly
         awaited "Orac" episode of BLAKE'S SEVEN (*not* this Sat pm)
         has been contemptuously replaced by a "Gene Kelly double
         bill" leaving Saturday night for ROBOCOP (2) (again -
         11.10pm, Sat, ITV), with Weller/ Allen sleepwalking through
         Frank Miller's usual recycled script ideas... Chris Rock
         heads up rap-umentary spoof CB4 (12.20am, Sat, BBC2) - not
         to be confused with the similarly themed "Fear Of A Black
         Hat"...  while neurological deficit edutainment PHANTOMS IN
         THE BRAIN (8pm, Fri, C4) leads neatly into brain-damaged
         Sandra Bullock hacker-virus nonsense THE NET (9pm, Sun,
         C4)... Errol "Fast, Cheap And Out Of Control" Morris
         hopefully uses different criteria to select the naive
         execution expert profiled in TRUE STORIES: MR DEATH (9pm,
         Mon, C4)... Adam Hart-Davis cycles through another run of
         DIY historical inventions slot LOCAL HEROES (8pm, Tue, BBC2)
         - more welcome than the return of stand-up manque Michael
         Moore in his self-descriptive THE AWFUL TRUTH (11.30pm, Tue,
         C4)... and in one of those ironic twists that no-one else
         mentions, SEX AND STOPPING (10.15pm, Wed, BBC1), a
         "light-hearted" history of contraception, is presented by
         none other than Nick Hancock, one of the single most
         persuasive arguments in favour of it...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; in a far-off, decadent age, lower-class "barbarians"
         brawl and cavort to the mock-horror of their more "civilised"
         audience - but enough about Sex Pistols rebellion-nostalgia
         biopic THE FILTH AND THE FURY (imdb: independent-film / music
         / punk-rock) - what about Ridley Scott's semi-CGI beat-em-up
         GLADIATOR (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/">http://www.capalert.com/</a> : gruesome defensive
         killings; lusting after blade fighting and gladiatorial
         killing; intentional trampling of a 8 year old boy; flatulence
         as a street puppet show "weapon")? Battle scenes are, indeed,
         judderingly spectacular, interspersed by agonisingly dull
         dialogue and occasional Blade Runner references - but not
         quite, as James King of Radio 1 seems to think on the poster,
         "Truly the most epic movie of the last decade" (or even of 
         this one)... otherwise a selection of, shall we say, more
         "female-friendly" flicks, in the form of WW2-era teen sex
         romance SNOW FALLING ON CEDARS (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/">http://www.capalert.com/</a> :
         "clothing falling on the ground", more like!)... and what
         looks like Nora "Sleepless In Seattle" Ephron's sisterly
         remake of "The First Wives' Club", with Diane Keaton, Phoebe
         Kudrow and (natch) Meg Ryan's extended phone metaphor HANGING
         UP (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/">http://www.capalert.com/</a> : most atypical of [Cloris]
         Leachman's usual parts such as Granny of "The Beverly
         Hillbillies" where what I would like to believe is her true
         genius was revealed)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         PRO-CELEBRITY PUBLISHING FEEDBACK&gt;&gt; yup, we know, we did mags
         and stuff last week, but felt we should try to defuse the
         sheer ferocity of this week's mailbag as soon as possible -
         almost all of it directed toward other NTK readers, we were
         reassured to note... JACK SCHOFIELD kicked off by defending
         Guardian Online's "Will Pokemon catch on?" headline [NTK 2000-
         05-05] as "ironic" - that's nothing Jack, you should have seen
         what they wanted us to put... several wrote to applaud last
         week's attack on TV's DOTCOMEDY, described by one of you as "a
         show that seems to be amazed that humans have sexual organs
         and can't keep its excitement to itself"... and at least two
         people bought MEN'S QUEST magazine, on the strength of last
         week's (sarcastic) "recommendation", only to pronounce it
         somewhere between "awful" and "shite". In another of his
         (humorous) flights of fancy, Angus "Rough Guide To The
         Internet" Kennedy reveals that it's not him, but "an
         imposter" behind MQ magazine ("I believe he chose the name
         because he thought it sounded very masculine"), which would
         explain why none of the heartfelt, windswept creator bios at
         <a href="http://www.mensquest.com/irishtimes.html">http://www.mensquest.com/irishtimes.html</a> make any mention of
         (presumably) substantial royalties from a regular top-10 non-
         fiction bestseller... again from NTK 2000-05-05, DARREN
         SOMETHING [nee IRVINE] hit back at Connor McLaughlin, unable
         to "believe McLaughlin has the nerve to describe [Internet And
         Comms Today] as 'crappy' when he and his fellow Fidonetteers
         used to fawn over myself and John when we deigned to grace
         them with our august presences"... while WENDY GROSSMAN bravely
         asserted that she "used to write for Internet and Comms Today.
         And was friend to no-one" - this, we hope, in reference to the
         claims of alleged editorial cronyism, rather than a more
         general outlook on life... and, finally, "Don't forget to
         tease me about this", mailed someone claiming to be "CHRIS
         WARD-JOHNSON AKA DR KEYBOARD" (is that how he introduces
         himself - "Chris Ward-Johnson - aka: Dr Keyboard"?), linking to
         another of The Register's meticulously researched stories on
         him: <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/000510-000018.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/000510-000018.html</a> . Oh,
         come on Keyboard (if it really *is* you, our old arch-enemy),
         this is hardly playing the game now is it? Where's the sport
         in that?...
