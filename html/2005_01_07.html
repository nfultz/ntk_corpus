         But the dependence on computers by the industry means 
         passengers are likely to see more flight delays caused by 
         computer errors in the future. "I'm afraid so," said airline 
         industry analyst Michael Boyd. "As long as *computers continue 
         to be made and operated by humans*, we're going to have the 
         problem..." [our emphasis]

         to bring back its body! Ah, we wish: but if you'd like to
         dick around with vector graphics without delving into
         Macromedia's proprietary little quarterback, Walter Zorn's
         ingenious JAVASCRIPT VECTORGRAPHICS LIBRARY may be worth a
         peek. Using coloured DIVs and some of that old Bresenham
         algorithm magic, Zorn has done the impossible:
         standards-based, programmatic drawing of lines, rects, and
         ellipses anywhere on the Web's broad canvas, from IE 4
         upwards. Performance is... forgiveable: old schoolers may
         find themselves typing "FOR I = 0 TO 360" instead of legal
         JavaScript at times. The library has been around for so
         long, we're surprised it hasn't popped up more before; but
         there's still time to score ridiculous amounts of hits for
         your JavaScript implementation of Missile Command.

         title of doubtless-abysmal new sitcom ACCORDING TO BEX (9pm, 
         Fri, BBC1), though perhaps it was called "The Joy Of Bex" or 
         "The Opposite Of Bex" in development and changed at the last 
         minute... the BBC come up with an innovative new vehicle for 
         expensive acquisition Dom Joly - aimless, "absurdist" hidden-
         camera pranks - in WORLD SHUT YOUR MOUTH (10.35pm, Fri, BBC1) 
         - should be more laughs in imaginative teen-horror procedural 
         FINAL DESTINATION (11.05pm, Fri, BBC1)... and it's not 
         entirely clear where the estimate of "3000-8000 obscenities" 
         originally came from (The Daily Mail?), but given that Richard 
         "Fist Of Fun" Thomas and Stew Lee's JERRY SPRINGER - THE OPERA 
         (10pm, Sat, BBC2) is only 2 hours long, that's an impressive 
         rate of one every 2.4-0.9 seconds... the world seems strangely 
         less outraged by the prospect of imminent environmental 
         catastrophe, as highlighted by C4's WAR ON TERRA season 
         (7.30pm, Sat, C4), also featuring "current effects of climate 
         change" SEVEN DAYS THAT SHOOK THE WEATHERMEN (8pm, Sun, C4) 
         and anti-car exploration WHAT WOULD JESUS DRIVE? (8pm, Mon, 
         C4)... political reality-show VOTE FOR ME (11pm, Mon-Fri, ITV) 
         falls into the usual trap of assuming that the public will 
         deign to exhibit even the slightest interest in the "winners" 
         of these programmes ever again... while a new series of HORIZON 
         (9pm, Thu, BBC2) preserves its up-to-the-minute reputation 
         with an overdue look at the phenomenon of "global dimming":
