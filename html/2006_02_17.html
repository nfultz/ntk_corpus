         hopefully, the paramilitary wing of NTK's audience. So, if
         you'd always wondered whether there wasn't more you could do
         (than just saying sarcastic things in a quiet voice) against
         Krazy Kopyright enforcement, brain-dead Parliamentary
         legislation, internet breakage, media ignorance about tech,
         and surveillance society sleep-walking, then go right ahead.
         You can now pay up your fiver a month with aplomb, and

         it's also time for one of those evenings where we grab a few 
         Brits who spoke at O'Reilly's Emerging Technology conference, 
         then get them to (briefly) describe what they talked about - 
         and any other decent stuff they saw. This year, ETech runs 
         from March 6-9, and we're just in the process of confirming a 
         lineup for a central London location on the evening of 
         Thursday 2006-03-23, so don't say we never give you advance 
         notice or anything. Admittedly, most of the UK speakers we 
         recognise are from the London area, but we may be able to lure 
         the creators of social personal web archiving tool HANZO:WEB 
         over from Bristol as well - who describe their creation as 
         both "in public beta" and "the best bits of del.icio.us and

         last year: don't we all "remix" culture when, for instance, we 
         buy clothes or furniture and then combine them in a way that 
         isn't exactly the same as depicted in the shop? What do you 
         mean, "No, not really"? Expect somewhat more pragmatic 
         insights at Rufus "Open Knowledge Foundation" Pollock's FORUM 
         ON OPEN CONTENT (7pm, next Wed 2006-02-22, Stanhope Centre, 
         Marble Arch, London W2 2HH, free but pre-register if you can),

         Jennifer "BBC Creative Archive" Rigby, and Cory "DRM's gonna 
         get ya!" Doctorow will be considering: Who will be producing 
         open content and how will it be funded? Does copyright hinder 
         the process, or help? And is the vibrant DJ culture of the UK 
         at least partly inspired by our culinary tradition of taking 
         boiled root vegetables, like the potato, then "mashing them 
         up" (perhaps with other tasty ingredients) to produce the 
         ideal accompaniment to a meal of sausages and baked beans?

</span><span class="item">         Did you, like us, read that "Britons waste the equivalent of 
         around two power stations' worth of electricity each year by 
         leaving TV sets and other gadgets on standby" - in a room lit 
         only by the muted, submarine-movie glow of power supply LEDs? 
         And did you also wonder if only there was a semi-elaborate 
         technological solution to this ongoing wastage, rather than 
         the physical and mental effort of constantly switching 
         everything off at the plug? Step forward the ONECLICK 
         INTELLIGENT MAINS PANEL, an 6-way surge-protector which
         keeps your PC (or hifi amp, or TV?) on standby as normal, but 
         completely cuts power to all the other sockets when the master 
         device "shuts down". They cost UKP 24.95-29.95 from Maplins or 
         the manufacturer's site - unless you're installing, like, 
         millions of them, you're not likely to save the planet, but a 
         PC Pro review estimates this pioneeringly electronically-
         assisted laziness could save you upwards of UKP14 per year.

         collect spores, molds, and fungus - I think it's the food of 
         the future". But, nonetheless, kudos to those NTK readers who 
         still dabble in this self-consciously "retro" artform, 
         especially when they're as forward-thinking as CHARLIE STROSS, 
         who's saved you the trouble of OCR-ing his latest multiply-

         online: <a href="http://www.accelerando.org/2005/06/28/">http://www.accelerando.org/2005/06/28/</a> . This kind of 
         undermines ANDREW CHAPMAN's claim of a "UK publishing first" 
         for his company's "entirely free download of a full-length 
         novel": <a href="http://readreverb.com/?s=content&amp;p=get">http://readreverb.com/?s=content&amp;p=get</a> - said novel 
         being C M Taylor's LIGHT, a "poignant story of love, loss and 
         English summer" set amid the "art and media world of the late 
         1990s". Still, if you don't like it, you can always use their
