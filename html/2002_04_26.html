</span><span class="item">         Theoretically there are all kinds of ways which you could 
         oppose the EUROPEAN UNION COPYRIGHT DIRECTIVE, but one which 
         won't currently land you in jail is attending next Monday's 
         CAMPAIGN FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS MINICONFERENCE (6.30pm, Mon 2002-
         04-29, City University, London EC1, free). Previously 
         described by us as a "poorly localised version" of the ever-
         popular US Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the EUCD is of 
         course a similarly stealthy attack on fair use (and/or casual 
         piracy) of digital content, implemented by - among other 
         things - giving greater legal protection to any "technical 
         protection measures" which the rights-holder puts in place. 
         Which, we like to think, is like trying to stamp out 
         trespassing by making it illegal to climb any kind of fence. 
         Linux second-in-command ALAN COX will be predicting the 
         "Effects Of The EUCD On Open Source Software Development, The 
         Software Industry And Disabled Access", the Campaign For 
         Digital Rights' MARTIN KEEGAN will be dishing out legal advice 
         and, on the basis of previous get-togethers, they'd especially 
         like to hear from librarians, lawyers, open source advocates, 
         musicians, authors and other rights-holders, and, last but not 
         least, anyone who's always wanted to be dressed up as William 
         Shakespeare and paraded around the UK's shopping centres in a 
         cage. (Presumably as part of some symbolic anti-EUCD protest, 
         though make sure you get that element in writing beforehand.)

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         As if that weren't enough for the lawyers to look forward to, 
         there's another new takedown procedure stalking the websites 
         of this fair country. This time, it's someone who wants his 
         own postings removed from the archive of Nigel Metheringham's 
         exim-user mailing list; the legal axe being wielded is the 
         Data Protection Act - and the motive? Who knows? Especially as 
         Mr Deleted's exim-user postings were hardly controversial. A 
         bit naive, perhaps, but really nothing compared to the deluded 
         rantings most of us have in the indestructible archives of our 
         online pasts. So why go to such trouble to get them removed? 
         If Captain Scribble is trying to prevent spam-harvesting of 
         his email address: well, sending nasty letters to public 
         mailing lists you actually subscribed to seems a bit of a 
         heavyhanded way of tackling the problem. And what about all 
         his posts to Debian mailing lists where his address also 
         appears? We can't imagine the internationalist, freedom-
         loving, legally-rigorous Debianites will keel over so easily. 
         The other possibility, we suppose, is that it's a bold attempt 
         to prevent even the smallest hint of public fallibility from 
         being detected online. Well, that certainly did the trick.

</span><span class="item">         But as the Data Protection Act taketh with one hand, so it 
         also gives with the other. Just to highlight our ambivalence, 
         the sinister-but-sometimes-sweet Office of the Information 
         Commissioner has indirectly provided us all with the sweetest 
         of old skool gifts: a new phone system pheature. In one of its 
         talmudic judgements, the OIC has decided that the number you 
         leave on other people's caller-ID records should be, as 
         personal data should always be, deleteable. From last month, 
         dialling 1475 will remove the last recorded incoming number on 
         a phone, in such a way that dialling 1471 afterwards on the 
         same device will just hit "Number Withheld". Reactions, where 
         they exist, are mixed. The outraged NTK subscriber who spotted 
         this in the latest BT brochure claims, in a beautifully Daily 
         Mail-ian coinage, that it's "a Philanderer's Charter". We just 
         thought it was another interesting trick to impress your mates 
         at the local 2600 meet. After the fourth or fifth Happy Meal, 
         perhaps.

         from the floor and generally "gathering information" during 
         the event. It won't be hard to show more clue than some of the 
         whitehats at this week's INFOSEC EUROPE, where an NTK reader 
         spotted someone jotting down the names of the reformed haxxors 
         in a discussion panel, and apparently mishearing "Coldfire" as 
         "Coalfire".

</span><span class="item">         A couple of weeks ago we linked to Michael Greene's Grammy 
         speech "The Insidious Virus of Illegal Music Downloading", 
         wondering if, as source material for sampling enthusiasts, it 
         might just live up to its name. DJ C0ntaX, of the KPMG Jungle 
         massive, is our first audioshopper of the file, with his 
         suitably spooky remix of Greene's "Death of The Music Industry 
         Foodchain" rap, encoded in the popular MP3 protocol, as used 
         on your pervasive, out-of-control, and oh-so-criminal file-
         sharing networks. In the next couple of weeks, we confidently 
         predict we'll be outshone by another activist group's 
         multimedia announcement, but in the meantime there's still an 
         opening for a Chris Morris-style cutup of the original to say 
         something a bit more, shall we say, "revealing" about the 
         music biz.

         and Janet Street-Porter are among C4's TOP TEN TV REBELS 
         (10.30pm, Sat, C4)... leading into a unconventional batch of 
         Saturday movies which includes THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER 
         (10.20pm, Sat, BBC1), THE BOYS FROM BRAZIL (1.10am, Sat, C4), 
         THE FRENCH CONNECTION II (11pm, Sat, BBC2) and WEEKEND AT

         TAKING OF PELHAM 123 (11.15pm, Sun, BBC1), THE HITCHER (10pm,

         LOADED, AND POSH (9pm, Mon, ITV)... the schedules look more 
         and more like TVGoHome in the form of harrowing Belgian 
         serial-killer mockumentary MAN BITES DOG (11.35pm, Mon, C4), 
         confrontational new reality gameshow DIET OR DIE (10.35pm, 
         Tue, BBC1), and Omid "The Mummy" Djalili's lifestyle swap AT 
         HOME WITH THE CRACKHEADS (11.05pm, Tue, C4) - all scarier than 
         John Carpenter's substandard John Wyndham remake VILLAGE OF

         returns in Karen "Raiders of the Lost Ark" Allen "Dead Calm"-
         alike VOYAGE (11.45pm, Thu, BBC1)... it's the bearded, good 
         Robin Williams giving Robert De Niro shock doses of L-DOPA in 
         neuro-drama AWAKENINGS (8pm, Wed, C5)... as PANIC MECHANICS 
         (8pm, Thu, BBC2) welds together bits of its "Scrapheap 
         Challenge" and "Salvage Squad" predecessors, right down to 
         bald-headed presenter Trevor Nelson instead of Lee Hurst...
