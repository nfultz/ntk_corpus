</span><span class="item">         The NATIONAL CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE helpfully pitched
         into the no-really-very-soon-now cursed E-COMMERCE crypto
         legislation. Director General John Abbott said that a number
         of serious criminal cases had been hampered by the perps'
         use of encryption. To back this up, three vague case studies
         were presented. You know, even we lunatic extremists here at
         NTK do accept this argument - that law enforcement needs
         assistance in crypto cases. We become even more convinced
         they need help when we see the NCIS picking three tales
         where the proposed new law would be *no* use at all. All
         three were nasty individuals (terrorists, child pornsters,
         murderers, PGP users) encrypting data on their permanent
         hard drives, an area where the new law has very little
         purchase at all. So, two questions for the NCIS: how would a
         voluntary system stop this (or do you want to make it
         illegal to use any encryption, even on home computers,
         without key escrow?). Secondly, why is it that none of the
         cases address what everyone in business is worried about -
         the deliberate weakening of encrypted communication over the
         Internet? Getting into secret files, sure: desirable, but
         impossible to enforce. Crippling of government-supported
         commercial and personal transactions on the Net to allow
         transparent tapping of anyone's communications? Possible,
         but is that what you really want? Yeah? Then argue the case.

</span><span class="item">         It's good to see that the new brooms at the TIMES
         INTER//FACE section haven't damaged its reputation for
         clear, honest, factual reporting. While we usually keep our
         coverage of their work to Antinews, we thought this week's
         excelled itself so admirably that we'd give you a full run
         down. Inside: The supplement welcomes the arrival of the new
         Star Wars prequels, featuring "Luke Skywalker and friends".
         Evil virus writers are planning to tie-in their work with
         the Y2K bug (what?). A "new online guide to virtually every
         movie" is premiered: it's 1990's very own
         <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">http://www.imdb.com/</a>. And finally, an impartial piece on
         Open Source Software, which says "there are alarming
         parallels between a fanatic organisation and the way the
         Open Source movement can behave. Journalists have been known
         to receive death threats for daring to question the
         movement's ideology". Nigel Powell, journalist, writes that
         Eric Raymond himself "flew into a rage" when Nigel suggested
         that open source culture embodied the communist ideal. Well,
         he seemed very calm a few minutes later when he discussed
         "some clueless hack" with us. And we believe the words were
         "oh, fuck off". Maybe you're not asking daring enough
         questions? All this *and* Dr Keyboard - check the floor of

         on a new dimension on Wednesday, when UUNET opened its
         Manchester Point-of-Presence to incoming calls *and* 
         incoming cars. An out-of-control vehicle embedded
         itself into in the wall of the Manchester Telecity building,
         and ended up parked in the UUNet suite of machines. While
         the machines did not suffer any downtime, Telecity
         operations did manage to inform the UUNet technical staff
         with a brief e-mail. "There is a car in your pop. All fine."

         30fps. The program, which is only 175850 bytes zipped, is titled

         Oh, well, I'm sure your cooler friends have backups. Looks
         like we'll have to go back to playing with this port of Doom
         for the TI-82 Graphing Calculator.

         GRAHAM NORTON - SO CONNECTED (10.30pm, Fri, C4) purports to
         be a "best of" the last series, before (oh god) a new one
         starts next week... equally high-pitched porn-fixated THE
         RUPAUL SHOW (1.20am, Fri, C4) isn't part of 4Later's SCI-FI
         MUTANTS strand (from 11.20pm, Sat, C4), featuring cult
         Argentinian soft-core THE CURIOUS CASE OF DR HUMPP (1.15am,
         Sat, C4)... but should keep you awake till the long-awaited
         return of godlike video sarcasm POP-UP VIDEO (2.50am, Sat,
         C4)... speaking of sci-fi mutants, not too sure about the
         shape-changey girl and lame new theme music in the second
         series of SPACE: 1999 (3.40pm, Sat, BBC2)... the shock
         table-turning conclusion of ANIMAL MINDS (6pm, Sat, BBC2)
         has chimps trying to measure the intelligence of Jane
         Goodall... C4's WW2 season continues with Japanese
         co-production TORA! TORA! TORA! (8.55pm, Sat, C4), after
         painfully slow repeat of STATION X... we made the Namco gag
         last time for the cinema re-release of Lee Marvin arty
         hardman trip POINT BLANK (9pm, Sat, BBC2)... and DANCES WITH
         WOLVES? (10.55pm, Sat, ITV) - smells-of-wee, more like...
         stagey Bosnian sniper drama SHOT THROUGH THE HEART (10.10pm,
         Sun, BBC1) is not based around the Bon Jovi song with the
         same opening line: "And you're too blame/ You give love a
         *bad name* (Bad name!)"... if those Mariah Carey / Ike
         Turner marriage rumours are true, maybe she should watch the
         not-so rhetorical Tina biopic WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT?
         (10pm, Sun, C4)... Mark "Dr Chinnery" Gatiss mines his
         previous career as New Adventures Of Dr Who author when a
         "thing" is dug up by THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN (9.30pm, Mon,
         BBC2)... and those idiots who did the C4 Roswell alien
         autopsy docu get a 3-part UFO series to solve the RIDDLE OF
         THE SKIES (8pm, Mon, C4)... about as plausibly, the couple
         who fooled the fly-on-the-wall crew last year claim to be
         telling the truth this time on CUTTING EDGE (9pm, Mon,
         C4)... just in time to be exposed again on TV hoax
         investigation FAKING IT (10.30pm, Tue, C4) - believed to be
         "the new media sabotage" (pardon?)... an inspirational,
         rather more realistic attitude to home improvement with
         three people who never do any housework in COMING CLEAN
         (10.15pm, Tue, BBC2) ... and wholesome kiddie-script cuties
         Sarah Jessica Parker - from FLIGHT OF THE NAVIGATOR (2.35pm,
         Sun, BBC2) - and Kim "Mannequin" Cattrall go all
         "dirty-something" in frank, provocative etc SEX AND THE CITY
         (10pm, Wed, C4)... David Koresh looks oddly like Bill Gates
         in dramatic retelling of AMBUSH IN WACO (12.05am, Thu,
         BBC1)... and surely HORIZON (9.30pm, Thu, BBC1) should be
         paying more attention to classic sci-fi films when they
         travel to the Arctic Circle to dig up a lethal virus buried
         there since 1918...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; acclaimed playwright finds inspiration in other
         people's material, extra-marital affairs - but that's enough
         about Tom Stoppard because SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE (imdb: 1500s
         / 1590s / biographical / historical) largely triumphs over
         its O-level-flattering corny cod Tudor trappings, and is
         directed by John Madden, author of the Megadrive's best-ever
         American football game... not sure what kind of message
         putting "It's bad. It's very bad" on the posters sends out,
         but ultra-dark Shallow Grave-style accidental murder
         "comedy" VERY BAD THINGS (MPAA: Rated R for strong, grisly
         violence) is far more unpleasant than even the presence of
         Christian Slater and Cameron Diaz would normally alert you
         to... TWO GIRLS AND A GUY (MPAA: Rated NC-17 for a scene of
         explicit sexuality) isn't the alternative title for Susan
         Sarandon / Julia Roberts / Ed Harris weepie STEPMOM (MPAA:
         Rated PG-13 for language and thematic elements), but a
         talk-heavy sexual politics menage a trois with Robert
         Downey, Heather Graham and Natasha "Mind Ripper" Wagner that
         even sticks too many words into its tagline: "Thanks to his
         two girlfriends/ Blake's about to learn a new sexual
         position./ Honesty." Given the illustration, the "two
         girlfriends" bit is redundant and defuses the double
         punchline - we reckon they should have gone for: "Blake's
         about to learn a new sexual position. Honesty" then, down at
         the bottom of the poster in brackets: "(Thanks to his *two
         girlfriends*!)"...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FEEBDACK&gt;&gt; proof-reading motorbike consultant to the stars
         PAUL BLEZ writes to complain about the mis-spellings of
         "wander" and "meagre" in last week's issue, but missed our
         slightly more embarrassing confusion between the Annals Of
         Improbable Research and the Journal Of Irreproducible
         Results in NTK 1999-01-15, and the missing "h" in "Cthulhu"
         in NTK 1999-01-22. Or did we deliberately avoid spelling it
         out in full, for fear of invoking the Old Ones
         themselves?... similarly, the "Providence, Rhode Island"
         reference in this DTI press release
         <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/IBB/US/1999-01-014.html">http://www.dti.gov.uk/IBB/US/1999-01-014.html</a> should "send a
         shudder through any HP Lovecraft-aware crypto worriers",
         says STUART HOUGHTON, the 70,000 per cent enhancement
         offered by "Ntru" surely evidence of n-dimensional
         tampering... the ubitiquous KRAGEN asks whether we *really*
         meant to say that someone had *patented* Princess Diana,
         instead of trademarking her virtual likeness? We're not sure
         if we're even allowed to answer that... while we're at it,
         we'll sneak in the corrigenda that SEGA DREAMCAST may be
         water-cooled after all, just don't blame us if they start
         blowing up if you leave them on all day... "Why doesn't Geek
         Media include radio?", inquires SUE BROOM of the BBC Science
         Unit (natch). "It does come in digital these days and for a
         mere UKP700 you can listen in true DAB at home." Sadly, Sue,
         our computers interfere with FM reception and we never
         switch them off, so we know little of this "Logged On",
         "Frontiers" or "new series on the brain" of which you speak.
         Audio fans, keep us posted... and finally the remarkably
         named BREMSTRAHLUNG X JONES informs us that, as far as he
         can establish, "he's the only person who watches Buffy The
         Vampire Slayer for reasons other than to masturbate at the
         lead". He watches it "to masturbate at the slightly geeky
         one"... you know, this is the kind of subscriber information
         marketeers kill for...
