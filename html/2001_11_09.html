</span><span class="item">         She may be "Torn", but who'd have thought this also meant
         fashionably "pre-ripped"? NATALIE IMBRUGLIA's "White Lillies
         Island" album has beaten Michael Jackson to the public enemy
         number one spot by being the first major UK CD release to
         feature "Cactus Data Shield", a copy protection system which
         ostensibly prevents MP3 swapping by corrupting the table of
         contents so it won't play on PCs (or PlayStations, and some
         other DVD players as well?). However, in a bid to retain
         her Aussie indie-pop credentials, Natalie don't seem to know
         - or seem to care - what copy protection is for, and, in a
         bizarre bid to pacify PC users, the disc also contains a
         Windows app which will play the entire album from a chunked
         42meg MP3 file - at a scorching 128kbps, hi-fi fans. They're
         not exactly "lying naked" on the CD - it's some weird
         proprietary format - but NTK reader MIKE GRAY has already
         successfully burned the files and the player onto a CDR, where
         they sound as "bloody awful" as they did on the original
         ("They couldn't even be arsed putting the track titles onto
         the files", he fumes). So: a CD which won't play under Linux
         or MacOS, but which is actually *easier* to pirate under
         Windows? That's what we call a "difficult" second album.

         Webmaster for revealing the location of their public site

         lecture them on the importance of "full disclosure"? Be all

         multinational to stop its la-la-la-not-listening approach to
         Global Warming, while sneakily creating a network of local
         community mailing lists which will henceforth evolve into a
         practical grassroots network and not just collapse into a

         not as if weblogs won't be carefully auto-saved by the
         proposed new data retention rules. And you don't have to be
         fashionably terrorist anymore: the Guardian revealed this
         week that these logs could be inspected for *any* crime.  Or
         suspected malfeasance, even. Yep, it's the unholy alliance
         of the new Anti-Terrorist Bill and the old RIP provision to
         seize logs for national security and "the prevention and
         detection of crime". Meanwhile, the European Patent Office
         appears to have unilaterally declared software patents
         a-okay. And then, to top off a bad week, the CEO of the new
         Internet Content Rating Association mailed us to say that we

         October's Strange Attractor event when gawkers, who'd come
         along to see "what kind of freaks" were responsible for NTK,
         had their "minds blown" by the preceding explanation of
         wireless networking and had to leave before we'd even started.

         HOW TO BE AN OBSTACLE (from 10.30am, Sat 2001-11-10, from UKP9
         per day, the goddamn ICA, London), which handily seems to
         coincide with their despairingly titled WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO
         WITH IT? digital arts fest, featuring Jaron "Autodesk" Lanier,
         John Maeda from the MIT Media Lab, funny Japanese artists, and
         "an eerie SMS narrative", no less. Prompting at least one NTK
         reader to already mutter "Same weekend as EuroBSDcon" (started
         9am today Fri 2001-11-09, Thistle Hotel, Brighton, from UKP60
         per day).

</span><span class="item">         Americans have Thanksgiving, the British have Guy Fawkes
         Night, and NTK has the annual review of another bloody
         Windows compression utility. Well, it's 2001: and the new
         word for Pkunzip is ... ARJFOLDER 3.65. This utility, by
         Raphael Mounier, is so sleak, so tres moderne, as to have
         practically no interface at all. Open a zip file, and you
         get a standard Explorer window with the goodies inside. Drag
         and drop, cut and paste, explore and view as
         tartan-backgrounded Web page: it always acts the same as a
         standard folder. Similiarly, you create a zip file by the
         usual right-click folder-making behaviour. As the name
         suggests, Mounier's 540KB program handles ARJ too - and JAR,
         TAR, CAB, UUE, MIME, HQX and the obligatory Quake 3 map
         files. Sometimes reality oozes out from under Arjfolder's
         metaphor: thoughtlessly double clicking on zipped
         executables has them throwing up a "Where am I? Where are my
         DLLs? WHY AM I ENTOMBED IN CARBONITE?" error. ZIP "folders",
         even if they contain other folders, still sick out their
         entire contents into one directory. Also, it is French. But
         it works well. And given that everyone assumed that ZIP
         encoding would be assimilated into the OS years ago, it's
         nice to see that Microsoft leaving *some* breadcrumbs for
         indie developers.
