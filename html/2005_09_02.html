</span><span class="item_space">        
</span><span class="item">         How long has it been since that rash promise: to start a 
         member-driven digital rights group in the UK, funded by fivers 
         pledged by ragged-t-shirted philanthropists like yourself? 
         Just over an "NTK week", we'd estimate - or one of your earth 
         months. And the news? Well, dispensing with the traditional 
         policy of starting a public wiki, a mailing list, and then 
         trailing off awkwardly into an endless "design a logo" 
         competition, your deputised authorities have been hard at work 
         in the background: smooth-talking potential benefactors, 
         drugging and kidnapping would-be board members, and sidling up 
         to people who should know better and futilely hinting that 
         they should quit their day jobs. But time's a ticking on the 
         pledge, and there's a point where you have to say "screw this 
         top-down crap: let's become 'massively distributed' and get 
         everybody else to do the real work". That time is - very 
         close. But in the meantime, in the style of one of those 
         always-disappointing teaser campaigns, let us give a name to 
         our domain: Welcome, please, THE OPEN RIGHTS GROUP. Defenders 
         of freedom; drinkers of tea.

</span><span class="item">         Look, I JUST want to run cross-platform automated browser
         tests of my BLOODY dev website so I can TELL when I break
         stuff WITHOUT sitting there being MISTER CLICKY CLICKY
         TESTBOT myself. Is that so very HARD? Judging from the
         ingenious SELENIUM, which achieves the trick of automated
         web site regression testing, yes, it is hard:
         hack-on-top-of-hack hard. Instead of cheating and use IE's
         OLE2 automation, Selenium does this: it loads, in-browser, a
         bunch of javascript-driven browser frames on top of your
         site's pages, which are trapped within their own frame. Then
         the javascript does the clicky clicky on the lower frame,
         magically filling your website's forms and clicking links 
         in Safari, Opera, IE and Firefox, testing the resulting page
         appearances to ensure it fits in with what you want your
         site to do. The javascript frames take their orders from a
         set of instructions spelled out in an HTML table page, or
         can be driven by Ruby, Java or Python plugins (using a
         JS-&gt;local process communication protocol that's even more
         evil). The downside is that because of that darn javascript
         security model, your Selenium javascript and command tables
         have to be on the same server as your testee website. But
         don't worry: somebody's written a Selenium web proxy, which
         fakes Selenium's presence on any foreign site. And if you
         think that's sick, wait until someone introduces the
         Selenium coders to those Greasemonkey maniacs.
