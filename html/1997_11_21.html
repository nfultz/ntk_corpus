         However, since I punched Mr McCandless in the jaw following
         a drinking contest in which we, together with Bob Wright of
           ION Storm, consumed numerous beers, three Jack Daniels, a
              vodka, a tequila and a bottle of single malt Scotch, I
                             think nuptials are out of the question.

         into an East Kilbride CD plant and stole 100,000 MICROSOFT
         CD-ROMs plus 200,000 holographic certificates of
         authorisation. Actually, it's more likely to be an armed
         response to decreasing RAM prices, leading to a decline in
         "RAM-raiding" and a return to, ah, black market content
         provision. Microsoft attorney Nancy Anderson warned buyers
         to be on the lookout for software with "unusually low
         prices, no support manuals... and unprofessional

</span><span class="item">         A great Web job, we like to say, is 80% perspiration and
         20% termination - an adage born out with this week's
         freshly killed jobs. In the US, WIRED DIGITAL, the no-
         longer "Hot" Wired Web concern, culled a fifth of its
         squealing monkeys, while MSN quietly began global
         optimisations that will lead to a 20% speed-up in their
         payroll software. MSN is dumping content creation
         worldwide, moving to a cheaper "rip-off Yahoo" business
         plan. One casualty at MSN UK was producer STEVE BILLINGER,
         which now makes him an ex-ex-TV executive. "We really did
         tap into a desire from independent TV producers," he told
         The Guardian, revealing the wide-ranging knowledge of the
         Web audience that got him where he is today. "They were
         frustrated making CD-ROMs that were not getting into the
         shops and not getting used." Not as frustrated as anyone
         who tried to bloody use them, Steve. Still, better luck
         next medium!

</span><span class="item">         So, is the world really out to get Microsoft? Judging by
         the votes to make SUN the official source for the official
         International Standards Organisation's (ISO) Java
         specification, almost certainly yes. Despite confident
         crows by Redmond that Sun was, as a profit-making company,
         an unreliable guardian of an important industry standard
         (Kettle, Pot - Pot, Kettle), almost every country voted to
         support the proposal. The exceptions were freedom-loving
         China and the United States committee (who, coincidentally,
         held their meeting at Microsoft headquarters). Before Sun
         get excited, it's worth noting that the previous Language-
         Most-Likely-To-Succeed, C++, has just reached the end of
         its own ISO standardisation process. C++ first appeared
         around 1980.

</span><span class="item">         And finally, in this special all-Microsoft supplement: BILL
         GATES showed his new relaxed nature at COMDEX this week,
         with a light-hearted keynote address not dissimilar to that
         of the later, more "relaxed" Roman Emperors. Highlights
         included: live on-stage threatening of NT code-slaves
         (Lackey: "Hahaha. Must be a problem with this new beta
         [gulp]" Bill: "Mmmm... snappy"), public humiliation of
         court favourites (Steve Balmer was made to dress up as a
         QVC salesman and pitch Microsoft Bob), and parades of
         captured dignitaries (basketball king Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
         made to admit he couldn't double-click as well as Bill).
         Bill giggled like John Hurt's Caligula when pro-democratic
         weaklings were mentioned (the DoJ, Ralph Nader), and
         quietened only when a 6ft Praetorian Guard marine, Major
         Jim Cummiskey, stormed the stage. (Major Cummiskey:
         "knowing where the enemy is, and being able to call fire on
         him, to have him stop hurting you is really important to
         us." Bill: [nervous laughter]).

         for THE O'REILLY PERL RESOURCE KIT this Noel. Well,
         actually they will. They'll thank you once, a little
         awkwardly, then go very quiet as they flip through the
         three new Perl books, the CPAN CD-ROM and a Perl/Java
         module written especially for them by Larry Wall, creator
         of Perl. Then you won't see them until the New Year, when
         they'll return from the computer room drooling and
         delirious.

         excellent) ADAM AND JOE SHOW (11pm, Sat, C4) may help them
         shake off that "junior Lee &amp; Herring" tag... contrary to
         Time Out's ill-informed "preview", radio docu POP GOES THE
         WEB (9.30pm, Sun, Radio 1) devotes about half its airtime
         to kewl MPEG sites... the Radio Times perhaps shares too
         much by describing voyeur-murders classic PEEPING TOM
         (10pm, Sun, C4) as "a stunning metaphor for an audience's
         relationship with the screen"... if anyone can make

         an early-mammals expose entitled "When Pigs Ruled The
         World"... if Dominik Diamond *does* decide this should be
         the "last ever" series of GAMESMASTER (6pm, Wed, C4),
         surely they should just promote the recently re-instated
         Patrick Moore... vast numbers of Britain's youth now seem

         on ITN journo Michael Nicholson's real-life Bosnian-
         adopting antics, with Woody Harrelson as his sarcastic
         friend... REGENERATION (imdb: war / drama / psychology) is
         like Blackadder Goes Forth, only with war poems instead of
         jokes (did anyone *not* do Wilfred Owen at O-Level?)... and
         Brad Pitt and David Thewlis use comedy Nazi accents to
         enliven Dalai Lama ding-dong SEVEN YEARS IN TIBET (imdb:
         drama / biographical)... and if that doesn't leave you with
         post-traumatic stress disorder - you wait all year for a
         quirky American class-conflict romance, then two of 'em
         turn up at once: INVENTING THE ABBOTTS (imdb: drama /
         romance / 1950s / class-conflict) has Liv Tyler and
         Jennifer "Labyrinth, The Rocketeer" Connelly, while LAWN
         DOGS (imdb: drama) is like The Lawnmower Man without any
         computer graphics (- yikes!)... Alicia Silverstone seems to
         be playing the title role in EXCESS BAGGAGE (imdb:
         adventure / comedy), while Tim Robbins and Christoper
         Walken clearly had NOTHING TO LOSE (imdb: adventure /
         comedy) - you wait all year for a zany botched-kidnapping
         buddy flick, then... alright, just pointing out that,

         anyone who still remembers their graphics-heavy Amiga
         snoozerama SHADOW OF THE BEAST... put your foot down: TOTAL
         DRIVING (Ocean, PlayStation) feels like a kids' version of
         the still matchless V-RALLY, while TOCA (Codemasters,
         PlayStation) isn't bad but doesn't match the insanely
         uncontrollable speeds of TOURING CAR (Sega, Saturn) - and
         disappointingly (for Telegraph readers?) upcoming Sony '98
         racer GRAN TURISMO does not feature speeding Grandmas...
         well, obviously they couldn't afford to license the
         likeness of Harrison Ford (though *surely* they could have
         got Daryl Hannah or Rutger Hauer) but - to stay true to the
         film - shouldn't the point of BLADE RUNNER (Westwood, PC)
         be that you empathise more with the replicants than with
         the "humans"?... no recoil required for the extended
         version of arcade lightgun fave TIME CRISIS (Namco/Sony,
         PlayStation) - one of the few remaining games that still
         lets you shoot "real" people...
