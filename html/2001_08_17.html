</span><span class="item">         Well done to THE INDUSTRY STANDARD for slavishly improving on
         the original "Wired" business model - despite all the money
         wasted on short-lived European editions, the humble Wired UK
         operation never quite realised its ultimate goal of taking
         down the parent organism as well. But, as any keen new-economy
         bullshitter knows, adversity can often breed innovation -
         innovation like the bold new revenue stream proposed by Future
         Publishing's US incarnation, IMAGINE MEDIA, who seem to be
         charging between $500 and $5,000 per program for inclusion on
         forthcoming coverdisks of PC Gamer, MaximumPC, MacAddict and
         Official Xbox magazines. This "is not an advertising fee",
         an email, addressed to "Software Partners", explains - it
         is "a Distribution and Handling fee", which only happens to
         apply to "editorially selected disc content". And thank
         heavens for that, because when Amazon tried something similar
         a couple of years ago, the term everyone else seemed to prefer
         was "payola".

</span><span class="item">         Is that free speech burning, or just the spreading haze of
         DMCA smoke we smell? A fairly clear-cut case in Holland with
         Niels Ferguson, the Dutch cryptographer who knows how broken
         Intel's new content protection system is, but is too scared
         to tell anyone. But what about the curious case of ALEX
         SHTOL's WMA ENCODE/DECODER program? Alex's shareware app,
         which can create and export to MP3 Windows Media audio
         files, was removed from CNET's DOWNLOAD.COM last month
         without explanation. CNET now says that it's been deleted
         because it's in breach of the DMCA. In fact, WMA
         Decode/Encode is licensed by Microsoft to perform what
         deciphering it does, and is deliberately limited to comply
         with the requirements of their Digital Rights Management
         system. Compared to the fistful of other audio-decoding
         progs still on DOWNLOAD.COM, it's a veritable paragon of
         DMCA compliance. Of course, its country of origin is a
         little more exotic than its competitors: could it be that
         following Dmitry Sklyarov's arrest, CNET now thinks *all*
         programs from Moscow are illegal?

</span><span class="item">         Three reasons why RAZORFISH are the "Queen Mother" of new
         media: 1. The press love them - they can always be relied on
         for an "Oh, that's so cute" story; 2. Mere mention of their
         name conjures up upsetting mental imagery involving hideous
         teeth; and 3. Despite remarkable longevity so far, they're
         surely not going to be around *for ever*. On the off-chance
         that the current round of rumours turn out to be true and
         Razorfish *are* currently on the ropes, NTK would like to
         collect your recollections (and documentary evidence) of their
         most freakish projects and campaigns, just in case a last-
         minute "tribute" portfolio is required. For instance, we're
         convinced we can detect their distinctive fingerprints on that
         RAC relaunch ad which revealed that the Royal Automobile Club
         was no longer just some blokes in vans who fix your car when
         you break down, but (we're paraphrasing, of course) "a radical
         new paradigm in journey assurance en route from A to B".

</span><span class="item">         In the thrashing Cambrian slime-pits of sourceforge,
         it's a little hard to tell which projects are worth getting
         involved with, and which are the "Last updated two days
         after they started" no-hopers. As a general rule, the bigger
         the ambition, the more doomed the codebase - but there are
         always exceptions. Even though they (barely) missed an
         deadline this week, tigris.org's SUBVERSION looks like it's
         going somewhere fast. A ongoing plan to replace CVS with a
         more modern, backwards-compatible, replacement, Sub has
         survived an ambitious schedule, strong competitors, a
         pitched battle between ESR and one of his supercriminal foes
         on the dev list, and a potentially dull wall of code to climb.
         They've survived. This week was due to be the date that
         Subversion became self-aware (or at least, self-hosting):
         despite a flurry of activity, they didn't quite make it. But
         they're very close - and now would be a great point to get
         involved.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         HAL-LOO! &gt;&gt; "I'm trying to repel the American media",
         announced EMMANUEL GOLDSTEIN, keynote at the quadrennial
         Dutch hackers' conference, HAL 2001, playing to audiences'
         favourite phenotype this year: self-deprecating Americans.
         "Don't ever say Americans aren't tolerant - we've been
         tolerating shit from our government for years", he chuckled.
         Most unexpected revelation from Manny: during the recent
         unpleasantness, 2600 was swamped with e-mail urging them to
         cyber attack China, all from Hotmail accounts. The
         X-Originating-IP fields turned out to be *all* from .mil
         domains.... JOHN GILMORE spoke both about opportunistic
         encryption, and other opportunities he has personally
         enjoyed as a friend of Sasha "MDMA" Shulgin... oddest (we
         presume unconnected) sight: a 6'6" cross-dressing Lara
         Croft-alike ... PHIL ZIMMERMAN junked his talk on Hushmail
         2.0 in favour of a crowd-pleasing ramble on the history of
         PGP 2.0 (Half of all the e-mail he gets about backdoors in
         PGP are from Germans, who apparently adopt a "sort of quiet
         tone - it's okay, you can tell me if it's backdoored, I
         won't tell anyone".) Most unsurprising comment by PRZ: "For
         some reason, cryptography attracts paranoid people"...
         again, unconnected: FREESWAN's HUGH DANIELS gave three
         speeches, characteristically bitching about the nature of
         the universe in all of them ... Most European quote: "The
         best historical example [of the reaction to deCSS] is the
         churches response to printing presses" ... Returning nearer
         home (but not there yet), HAVENCO's RYAN LACKEY revealed
         Sealand's best-kept secret: the data haven is making a small
         profit, and he doesn't have a Sealand passport... Finally
         British DNSCon organiser JONATHAN WIGNALL gave a practical
         demo of a worm, including suggesting the best place to
         release duch a beast would be at a place with a few thousand
         suspects. He then withdrew the idea, on realising that at
         HAL he'd still be the *prime* suspect. Such nervousness may
         have affected his aim in the final distribution of goodies:
         I haven't had my photos developed, concludes our
         correspondent, but with luck I should have a shot of him
