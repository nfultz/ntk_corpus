</span><span class="item">         The BLOGGIES are announced, and all of the constantly
         updating, filter and linking, daily diarists of the Web are
         there to cheer the winners on. Excepting the
         <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">www.livejournal.com</a> folk, and those everything/nothing kids,
         and the advogato/kuroshin journalers, of course. Nope, this
         one's for people who do *proper* weblogs. But if so - where
         was JORN BARGER, weblog ur-father, the man who coined the
         very term? In one of those perfect coincidences, Jorn's
         website, <a href="http://www.robotwisdom.com">www.robotwisdom.com</a>, running since 1997,
         disappeared from the Web just about the time the Bloggies
         were being revealed. Of course, Barger's been "disappeared"
         off the blog community's giftlist for a while. When his
         Israel divestment campaign veered into what some called out
         as anti-semitism, shocked bloggers removed their links to
         him, like shoppers determinedly looking away from a mother
         slapping her child. So it's unlikely he'll snatch that
         lifetime achievement award any time soon. Jorn's cranky, of
         course: a Kibo-loving hippy and underemployed Joyce fanatic
         who sits in his bed and scribbles about AI. Weblogging, like
         everything else he pursues, is an obsession. WIL WHEATON, by
         contrast, is the well-rounded cute geek boy of legend: the
         quoteable, filmable, film-quoting ex-RenFaire ex-Trekee
         yukster who tips a beanie to the Fark guys, knows the
         slashdot mod jokes, and gives respect where it's due. No
         surprise he won most of the awards. And isn't that what the
         Net's about?

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         After much deliberation, and some locking of people in our
         toilet, we decided to split the New Year "Design Our
         Stylesheet" prize. One half, as originally proposed, we set
         upon awarding to entrants who parodied other, pretty-boy,
         sites (while spurning the cheap shortcut of just linking to
         their own stylesheets and yes we do mean you, GORDON JOLY).
         The other half-award, we newly declared, was to be awarded
         to whoever of the remaining entrants most skillfully evaded
         the whole point of the competition. This was a practical
         decision. "Why not make it look a bit more like Ceefax?",
         wrote VANILLA BEACH, helpfully. "Everyone watched Ceefax."
         Stylish? Yes. A "sheet", Vanilla? No. In a similiar vein,
         RICHARD IRONS declaimed, together with many fully compliant
         whingers, "How about publishing NTK in XML format?". You
         need to wait until our 2003 competition, Richard, where
         readers will be asked to guess the CORBA interface to our
         .NET SOAP-over-NNTP API. You nut. Others complained about
         dabbling with CSS at all. Pigdog Journal's MR. BAD swung an
         uncharacteristically helpful bat here: "NTK readers can
         always use PigDog DeCSS to remove style-sheet shmoo -
         <a href="http://pigdog.org/decss/">http://pigdog.org/decss/</a> ". But to do so would only increase
         your liability to subpoena by legal spider-bots, and
         naturally, cause you to miss our sedulous runners up. Start
         with LES MCKENNA's defiant, "Yer back to basics VT100" stylee:
         <a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?style=http://www.carlisle.ac.uk/ntk.css">http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?style=http://www.carlisle.ac.uk/ntk.css</a>
         Move onto TOM GILDER's fantastic triple-bill homagerie,
         which came near to sweeping the boards (sucky in Opera) -
<a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?s=http://tom.vpwsys.co.uk/css/ntk/bbc.css">http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?s=http://tom.vpwsys.co.uk/css/ntk/bbc.css</a> and

         And finally, stumble upon PAUL HAMMOND's contribution, which
         combined both borderline parody *and* wilfull disruption:

         Mr Hammond and Mr Gilder receive halves of the T shirt
         prize for their effrontery; all other entries are to have
         their punishments mercifully withheld. We hope you're all
         very pleased with yourselves.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         The Realnames-style JINI private namespace - which we were so
         skeptical about back in December - seemed to have it all: an
         annoying IE plug-in which redirects words (and non-"www" URLs)
         typed in the address bar to the pages of those who've reserved
         those particular words for as little as UKP50 per month. Of
         course, the ultimate online endorsement can only come from a
         former household name/international music star, and Jini's
         arrived this week in the form of the Surrey-based net
         consultant who claims to work "for a woman called Joan
         Armatrading". Joan apparently "owns several keywords on
         various search engines", but would very much like to sublet
         some "to give smaller companies an opportunity to promote
         their businesses on the web cost-effectively". Her Jini
         keywords include "movies" and "pictures", both of which
         currently link to the official site of *the* Joan Armatrading.
         Without getting into "After They Were Famous" territory, is
         this really what the 1970s' answer to Tracey Chapman is up to
         nowadays? Is it just bizarre retaliation for net entrepreneurs
         like Cliff Stanford foraying into pop music with "Girls@Play"?
         And will stunts like this keep Jini themselves out of the
         "Where are they now?" file - along with the fact that, so far,
         we've found it impossible to uninstall the bastard thing?

         quite so many people to MILIA this year (from Mon 2002-02-04,
         Palais Des Festivals, Cannes, 350 Euros upwards), harrowing
         experimental electronica night DORKBOT LONDON has relocated to
         the slightly more central State 51 venue (7pm, Wed, 2002-02-
         06, free). NTK's "Dave Green" has been asked *not* to bring
         his guitar on this occasion, creating a breathing space for
         new acts like SIMON WISTOW to "kick, punch, it's all in the
         mind" on the subject of games and generative music, based
         around demos of titles like Rez, Vib Ribbon and Parappa The
         Rapper. Other attractions include electronic sculptor ROLF
         GEHLHAAR, "over-active" artist-musician TOM NULLPOINTER and,
         testing your recall of zany SOUND and VDU 19 commands to the
         max, a load of BBC Micros set up "just to see what people do".

</span><span class="item">         Compared to Mozilla, Konqueror, Opera, Galeon, Skipstone and
         the rest of the Unix browsers, DILLO is a scrappy little
         thing. Its HTML rendering isn't great; it don't do frames or
         CSS; no javascript, plugins or ftp. Right now, you need to
         apply source patches just to get SSL and cookies to work.
         But dillo has one feature: it's fast. Not "ooh let's get out
         our stopwatches and put it in a race with IE" fast: this is
         "what righteous voodoo hex has this mother *placed* upon my
         TCP/IP stack?". Dillo's written in C, with some threaded
         networking code you shan't want to look at: but the
         remainder is 200KB of eminently hackable GTK code. You won't
         want to use it as your everyday browser (yet). But you'll
         enjoy your current choice a *lot* less after you've seen this.

         overrated Linklater student-spanking frenzy DAZED AND CONFUSED

         (9pm, Sun, C5) is "a disappointing end to the Police Story

         indeed Kevin Costner's class tourism epic DANCES WITH WOLVES
         (10pm, Mon, C4)... while C5 sticks to what it knows best with
         Rutger Hauer terrorist Olympiad BLAST (9pm, Mon, C5)... hot on
         the heels of last October's "Gas Attack", SMALLPOX 2002 (9pm,

         PAYBACK (9pm, Tue, C5)... ROBOCOP 3 is on again (10.30pm, Tue,

         as the TV series... and new late-night comedy series THE
