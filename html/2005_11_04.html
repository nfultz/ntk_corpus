</span><span class="item">         HAHAHA! The Americans are funny! This Thursday, the funniest
         of them all, Mitch Bainwol of the MPAA, said with a straight
         face firstly how much he loved his MP3 player (glad you
         could enjoy it, after you tried to sue the Diamond Rio out
         of existence). Then, his organisation asked, very gently,
         for all digital radio players to be rigged so that: you can 
         only record for a minimum of 30 minutes; have no metadata
         storage at all; and only save a maximum of fifty hours of
         music, before the machines would start deleting - in strict
         FIFO order. That's the land of the free, my friend! Can't do
         digital TV, can't do digital radio, and when they do, they
         let their self-style "entertainment" industry drool DRM all
         over it! Never happen here, of course:

</span><span class="item">         Hopefully moving beyond a simplistic techno-libertarian "Well, 
         my computer seems able to copy all sorts of stuff, so it must 
         be morally justifiable *somehow*" riposte to this kind of 
         thing, the as-previously-advertised OPEN RIGHTS GROUP is 
         holding its first open-to-all get-together in London later 
         this month. What's definite so far is the date (the evening of 
         Tue 2005-11-29), the venue (the 01Zero-One Creative Learning 
         Lab cyber-basement, Hopkins Street, Soho, London W1F 0HS) and 
         the aim: for all potential members, the press, and any other 
         digital activists to meet each other and discuss what's 
         currently lighting up their personal early-warning systems. 
         Further details will be furnished closer to the time via the 
         organisation's conveniently just-launched official site, 
         including what time to actually turn up, whether you need to 
         pre-register (you know, for numbers), and tips on identifying 
         - let alone accessing - the venue's seamless metal door 
         embedded in an otherwise featureless brick wall.

         If that's true, then perhaps the secret of life-extension is
         GNU SCREEN. Which is here, not because there's anything new
         with it (it's nearly twenty years old, and no longer
         actively developed), nor has there been some new and
         wonderful application for it. It's still the same as it's
         always been - a program that lets you run more than one
         terminal session at a time, and switch between them, and
         re-attach to them if you lose the connection to a remote
         machine. It's just here because we sense that everyone is
         re-discovering it again, and we wanted to make sure, as
         ever, you smugly rediscovered it a fraction of a second
         before your friends.
