</span><span class="item">         To read the Proper Media, you'd assume that DEFCON 7.0
         consisted exclusively of the Cult Of The Dead Cow rerouting
         the Hoover Dam through Vegas, releasing the infamous
         "trojan/virus/powerful remote administration utility" Back
         Orifice 2000 ("Anyone curious enough to log on to their
         website will find their computer automatically infected with
         a virus." - The Guardian), then shooting each other. Allow
         us to inject a few genuine highlights. Best quotes: BRUCE
         SCHNEIER, who noted that "128 bits of symmetric key is
         probably good enough 'for ever'", while BT's quantum key 
         exchange over ten miles of cable will be useful 
         "approximately never". The con's most cutting criticism  
         came from those fleeing STEVE "wearable computing" MANN's
         demo: "Let's blow this shit - who wants to see some robot
         guy?". Research Least Likely To Be Covered In The Mainstream
         Media: ANGUS BLITTER's AFIRM - a hacker classification
         system based, it appears, on AD&amp;D character sheets. What was
         that? Real hacks? Oh, okay - for that, we choose L0PHT's
         exploit-in-progress  against Intel's Nightshade/Nightlight
         motherboards' Board Management Controller. Due to flaws in
         their (plaintext) authentication system, L0pht has been
         shutting down these babies with 50 bytes up the ethernet.
         Not crash, not hang: but gracefully power down. As our
         correspondent writes - fun to see that scale with broadcast
         packets in a server farm. Did Intel learn nothing from the
         Borg?

         MONEY, starring the teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off.
         But in the UK, the alternative challenge is to Win MARK
         BERNSTEIN'S Money, following news that lamer-loving BT
         call-generator WIREPLAY has been sold to the never-say-Falco
         Net.speculator who, regular readers will recall, was also
         involved with VR-losers Virtuality, ill-judged online
         games-monger E-ON, and the European version of GeoCities
         (what does that require, exactly - making the "Athens"
         subdir world-readable?). Wireplay went for "around UKP5.5m"
         though, of course, if BT were to, say, introduce free local 
         weekend calls any time soon, that's hardly going to improve
         those ping-times.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         SNAPPY QUESTIONS FOR DUMB ANSWERS&gt;&gt; (being an occasional
         series encouraging readers to ruin press conferences by
         asking smart-arse questions): ALISTAIR DABBS wins this week,
         with his query at the Acrobat 4.0 launch earlier this year.
         When Adobe's CHUCK GESCHKE demonstrated how the whole of
         Apple UK's Website could be converted into a PDF, Alistair
         asked if Chuck could see the irony of choosing the Apple
         site for the demo, since this feature is only available in
         the Windows version. Chuck's instant comeback: Adobe will
         have added this function to Mac Acrobat 4.0 by launch
         date. Impressive comeback? "I learnt fifteen minutes later
         from a whispering Adobe product manager", reveals Alistair,
         "that this was total bollocks, invented off the cuff by
         Chuck in order to shut me up." Okay, folks: now it's up to
         you to remind Chuck of his promise at every public
         appearance. And remember: the demo is only over when you're
         forced to leave the building.

         It's a stubby, simple tool, with thousands of potential (but
         as yet unforeseen) uses. Also - and this has to be the
         best indicator of a perfect CLI tool -  you've already
         guessed what it does from the name. Yes, it's a packet
         sniffer which can pluck out regular expressions from network
         traffic and pipe them to STDOUT. Like all things UNIX
         (including UNIX), we expect someone will eventually pervert
         this beautiful, theoretically and malicious tool for
         non-evil and practical purposes. In the meantime - have fun.

         remarkable theming, with ITV's "futuristic" (ie Logan's Run-
         inspired?) DIAL A DATE SPECIAL (12.40am, Fri, ITV), plus
         4Later's double-buffering of classic queue docus STAR WARS
         - or TATOOINE - OR BUST (12.05am, Fri, C4)... gorge
         yourself on the feast of Kubrick/ Trumbull eco-weepie 2001:
         A SPACE ODYSSEY (2.15pm, Sun, ITV) plus Trumbull/ R2D2 
         eco-weepie SILENT RUNNING (2.55pm, Sat, BBC2) - who could
         forget that moving end sequence when the dome-ships join
         Battlestar Galactica's rag-tag fleet?... attempts continue
         to revive Gerry Anderson live-actioner UFO (4.20pm, Sat,
         BBC2), and - of course - elderly car-chase caper THE DUKES
         OF HAZZARD: REUNION! (5.50pm, Sun, C5)... then the whole
         thing explosively decompresses in lame Sean Connery space
         Western OUTLAND (10pm, Sat, C4)... rather than Lucas or
         Spielberg, HOLLYWOOD'S MASTER OF MYTH (11.10pm, Sun, BBC2)
         is actually Joseph Campbell - the man who pioneered the
         revolutionary "character goes somewhere, does something"
         school of screenwriting... but a quick reminder of how good
         Spielberg used to be in JAWS (9pm, Sat, BBC1) - the
         character had "evolved considerably" by the time he 
         re-appeared in THE SPY WHO LOVED ME (8pm, Wed, ITV)... 
         fucking HACKERS (10pm, Mon, C5)... another fly-by for 
         dull-ish FOR THE LOVE OF - LUNAR CONSPIRACY (4am, Tue, 
         C4)... and, in what seems to be a new "chick TV" strand 
         on Weds, C4 have somehow resisted the temptation to combine 
         adjacent shows LOVE IN LEEDS (9pm, Wed, C4) and LOVE IN 
         THE 21ST CENTURY (9.30pm, Wed, C4) to create LOVE IN 21ST 
         CENTURY LEEDS...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; There *is* no "film". There is only STAR WARS -
         whose box office, MCV reports, may receive a boost from
         Sega fans keen to see the debut of the UK Dreamcast ads.
         Oh, and in case anyone's still puzzling over last week's
         wildly enthusiastic mystery review, it was of course 
         SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT - as featured at
         <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/southpark.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/southpark.htm</a> - and 
         not, as many of you thought, "Eyes Wide Shut" after all. 
         South Park *was* linked off their front page when we sent 
         out last week's issue, but subsequently disappeared -
         disappointingly, not to rise again on the third day. We're
         all going to burn in hell for this, you know...
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         SHINY ENTERTAINMENT&gt;&gt; many mags trying to boost summer
         sales with either Star Wars covers or extra nudity (SKY's
         "The Naked Issue", ESQUIRE's "Gail Porter: The Last Ever
         Naked Pictures"), yet no-one's dared for the obvious double-
         whammy: the cast of Star Wars, au naturel... still,
         admittedly, the Adam &amp; Joe SW bit in THE FACE isn't *too*
         bad... we never read the media sections, so this may be
         widely known; some anonymous tipster believes that EMAP has
         bought ailing Face, Arena, Frank-publishers Wagadon for "16
         million quid"... and good to see issue 3 of IPC's LATER is
         saving cash by running exactly the same cover image as the
         previous 2... isn't it about time you gave SFX another
         chance, especially now they - and "Tomorrow's Technology
         Today" stablemate, T3 - are touting their thrilling,
         revolutionary web presences - clearly accustomed to the 
         far-off sciences of the future, it's taken them this long to
         master basic tech of 3-4 years ago... someone involved in
         new Haymarket rag THE NET complains that we didn't diss its
         trade ads ("the worst I've ever seen"); his claim that the
         mag "treats the net as a media, rather than a computer
         related exercise" should, surely, speak for itself...
         hopefully a bit more cutting-edge attitude from upcoming
         CRAZYNET (due September from Freeway - not to be confused
         with Fleetway), helmed by former "Bizarre" managing ed and
         RPG self-publisher James Wallis. "Don't describe it as
         'BIZARRE about the net'", advises James, "or I'll kill
         you". Bring it on, big guy... oh, and this section just
         wouldn't feel complete without slagging the latest OFFICIAL
         PLAYSTATION MAGAZINE (UKP4.99), this month complementing
         its shit reviews of shit games and cod Chris Morris-isms
         with a dire "Analysis" piece on London's Namco World - ie
         tests of up-to-the-minute coin-ops Alpine Racer 2, Time
         Crisis 2, Tokyo Wars, and Prop Cycle. And what hard-hitting
         revelations forced them to tear page 91 out of every issue?
         Apparently, a Computer Exchange ad that offered a UKP99.99 
         Dreamcast if you trade in your Playstation. Let's not take 
         that "editorial independence" too far, eh?...
