</span><span class="item">         It was a week of keynotes, keywords, and kebabing in the
         JAVA corner of Internet World. MICROSOFT launched their
         latest Java compiler, designed to be just like everyone
         elses' offerings, except faster and more incompatible. They
         introduced their own set of classes, while refusing to even
         look at Sun's official set (literally - Microsoft's top
         Java man "deliberately avoided looking at the Sun JFCs"; in
         case he was turned, Indiana-Jones-like, into ashes?). And,
         following the official MS line of "if it ain't broke, fix
         it so it is", they added two extra keywords to the
         language. The Java purists responded with their "write
         once, run around everywhere - screaming" mantra, but worse
         was to come. On Wednesday, gaunt Apple, still slavering
         over Bill Gates' $150 million food parcel of last year,
         announced they were going with Bill's Java, not Sun's. As
         Sun whined, Microsoft's Steve Ballmer was gloating in the
         New Yorker about obtaining the original Java license: "We
         didn't come in there saying, 'Hallelujah brother, we love
         you Sun, you're our boys'". Not when Apple really *are*
         your boys.

</span><span class="item">         So, what happens when the ageing hippies of the Digital
         Revolution get even more aged, and *squishy-soft* on the
         truths they held so self-evidently dear? Well, all that
         cranky libertarianism goes out the window for a start, and
         shiny new TECHNOREALISM takes its place. A fine assemblage
         of cyberspace's comfortable-shoe-wearing thinkers took to
         the soapboxes on Wednesday to announce their
         Technorealistic manifesto. Among the new slogans being
         chanted on the barricades outside Harvard Business School
         was the catchy "Information wants to be protected",,
         "Government has an important role to play on the electronic
         frontier" and "Are technological changes good or bad?" -
         altogether now - "The answer is BOTH!". Interested parties
         (who must number at least twenty) looked forward to pitched
         street battles between the John Perry Barlite old guard and
         the cardigan-wearing shocktroops, but to no avail. For who
         were the first to offer their lives for the new crusade?
         Why, rumour has it, Wired editor and "hive consciousness"
         guru Kevin Kelly, Howard "psychedelic funster" Rheingold
         and ... Mr "Cyberspace Declaration of Independence"
         himself. So what would happen if they held a war, and every
         turned up on the same side?

</span><span class="item">         What does it matter if you let one ex-governor of Hong Kong
         go, when you have the whole of the EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT in
         your pocket? After initial pressure from Mr Murdoch's
         companies, the EU is currently moving to make not only the
         advertising and sale of pirate decrypting devices (like Sky
         smartcard hacks - ah, if they still worked) illegal Europe-
         wide, but also "the provision of information and measures
         facilitating unauthorised access". By the terms of the
         proposal, that would criminalise any attempt to demonstrate
         the weakness of, say, 40-bit crypto by brute force
         breaking, or indeed any public discussion of security
         weaknesses in an encryption system. That would put a bit of
         a damper on future <a href="http://www.distributed.net">www.distributed.net</a> efforts, news
         coverage of the latest BugTraq NT hole - and indeed, any
         discussion of crypto flaws at all. Oh, and if we were to
         tell you that you can log in to most registration Websites
         with the user id "cypherpunk", password "cypherpunk"? Well,
         we wouldn't, because they'd come and arrest us for it. Doh.

         incessantly about the "arts" and "humanities" the rest of

         next 10 days (clearly, it's a hyperfuturistic *decimal*
         week), largely based around UK techno central: London's
         Science Museum, South Kensington (open till 9pm Tue-Fri).
         Their centrepiece: help build the "world's largest
         diamond", though some listings don't seem to realise that -
         at 202kg, 3m high and comprising just "30,000 molecules" -
         it's clearly just a plastic model and not genuine
         crystalline carbon. If you can't cut it there, a vast
         touring Turing Test will come to you online, sponsored by
         Tomorrow's World MegaLab, the Electronic Telegraph, and
         FringeWare at the SXSW Interactive festival, Austin, Texas.
         Punters will be invited to vote on the human-ness of famed

         rehearsed RealAudio show and multimedia performance
         experience. Tune in at the URL below, or join us in our
         makeshift "studio" at the WEBSHACK, 15 Dean Street, London,
         England, UK, Earth. Highlights you may otherwise avoid
         include: a 24-hour "Smash Microsoft" Bill-a-thon, our hard-
         hitting game review "It Ruined My Life", spontaneous
         protests against the Starburst/Opal Fruit controversy,
         cruel and vindictive technical support calls with the man
         from <a href="http://www.superkaylo.com">www.superkaylo.com</a> , Memepool roundtable with guests
         Rupert Goodwins and ... um, some other people. And some
         other jokes. Show starts at 18.30GMT on Monday 16/3/98, but
         be sure to turn up early to guarantee a space. No, really.
         Free entry for those who turn up!

         manic depressives in their efforts to preserve the mystique
         of their "50% genius, 50% idiocy" product range. After the
         loveliness of Dreamweaver, they're due for a stinker in
         FIREWORKS, the new Web-oriented GIF design package.
         Unfortunately, it's too early to tell from the Beta
         Developer Premiere Overview Version they've posted to their
         ftp site. So early, in fact, we'd recommend you wait for
         the next Preview Pre-Release Time-Limited Version, when at
         least some of the cooler features won't be so horrifically
         slow. To pass the time, you could check out the new Initial
         Release Free Trial Sampler of Paintshop Pro 5. PSP remains
         the Photoshop for urchins set, but now includes proper
         layers, masks 'n' proper selection lassoos, a weirdo
         Picture Tube feature that promises great GIF cliche
         possibilities, and a nifty animation utility. Plus the
         chunky interface is guaranteed to piss off any Kai
         "Trouser" Krause fans in your office. Bo-nus!

         an ambient industrial racket. We'll mention it anyway.
         That's because RAIDER is actually a lot better than it
         sounds (literally!), and also because the author is moving
         into an office next to us soon, and if we keep on his good
         side maybe he won't turn into the "noisy neighbour" he has
         the terrifying potential to be.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV &gt;&gt; better late than never for the return of FATHER TED
         (9.30pm, Fri, C4; also 9pm, Sun) - a bit like a sitcom
         spinoff of the movie The Butcher Boy, only without all them
         murders... see how much bouncier Flubber would have been
         without Robin Williams in the original THE ABSENT MINDED
         PROFESSOR (3.10pm, Sat, LWT only)... THE SHADOW (8.15pm,
         Sat, BBC1) is the comic book movie adaptation with the
         power to cloud men's minds; and also features Alec Baldwin,
         direction from Highlander hack Russell Mulcahy, and a theme
         tune by Jim Steinman... BBC1's entire month's allocation of
         sassiness is required to enforce hilarity when RUBY WAX
         MEETS: THE SPICE GIRLS (7.30pm, Sun, BBC1)... and why are
         those suspiciously British helicopters hovering over the
         otherwise convincing 'Nam nightmare of Kubrick's FULL METAL
         JACKET (10pm, Sun, C4)?... as described in TO THE ENDS OF
         THE EARTH (8pm, Mon, C4), the Thylacine was actually a
         marsupial wolf, and not - as the Radio Times claims - "a
         kind of flesh-eating kangaroo"... WITNESS (9pm, Mon, C4)
         celebrates the eve of St Patrick's Day with accounts of
         Irish women institutionalised for sexual impropriety,
         narrated by Ballykissangel cleric-bait Dervla Kirwan... Who
         loves you? And who do you love? Arnie's back again in
         proto-Gladiators romp THE RUNNING MAN (9pm, Mon, C5)... you
         can't often go wrong with a Bill Murray movie, and he even
         co-directed meandering heist spoof QUICK CHANGE (10pm, Tue,
         C4)... Julian Clary apologises for a lifetime of useless
         material in FIRST ON FOUR (10pm, Wed, C4), including his
         famous "fisting" gag... and maybe they should transplant
         this week's "entertaining geneticists" DNA into all the
         other guests coming up on HORIZON (9.30pm, Thu, BBC2)...

         Nicholson and Greg "Talk Soup" Kinnear can't improve the
         cruel-yet-schmaltzy script in multi-Oscar nominated AS GOOD
         AS IT GETS (imdb: comedy / scar / waitress / sickness /
         relationship / mother-daughter / mental-illness / writing /
         homophobia / quirks / dog / lap-dog / single-parent /
         painter / drawing / misanthrope / racism / shrink / callboy
         / gay / love) And yeah, what kind of poster tagline is
         "Brace Yourself For Melvin"?... slight over-smugness is the
         capital crime of Hoffman/ De Niro spin-doctor spoof WAG THE
         DOG (imdb: satire / scandal / plane-crash / comedy /
         political) - disappointingly, it's not about a dog called
         "Wag" (then they could do a sequel called "Socks The Cat"),
         but more like a US version of Yes Minister... Denzel
         Washington's FALLEN (imdb: action / thriller / mystery /
         twist-in-the-end / drama / horror) also has John Goodman
         from Roseanne, and is a stylish extended X Files about a
         body-swapping murder-demon, largely spoiled by the fact
         that at no point does any character turn to the camera to
         say: "EXCELLENT! This new Earth-body... PLEASES ME!"...

         promises a "free-to-enter MENSA IQ test" - what, they mean
         "an ad"?... if you didn't already buy the last-ever SPY, it
         harbours a supercool science gossip column called A Hot
         Month Under The Lab Coat (p20)... current issue of
         "Spectrum And Emulators" zine THE ZX FILES (about UKP2,
         from <a href="mailto:paulwhite@thezxfiles.demon.co.uk">paulwhite@thezxfiles.demon.co.uk</a>) contains
         authentically badly written reports on Russian Spectrum
         clones, plus astonishing revelations about the Z80 versions
         of Dune 2 and Doom... yeah, we know, Websites don't really
         count, but EON ( <a href="http://www.eonmagazine.com">www.eonmagazine.com</a> ) comes from the folks
         who did the original Sci-Fi Universe mag (still light-years
         ahead of anyone else); it's now backed by ID4 producer Dean
         Devlin, and still features SFU sci-fi agony aunt Deep Space
         Nina... sticking online, POPGOB ( <a href="http://www.begbie.com/popgob/">www.begbie.com/popgob/</a> )
         is a refreshingly offensive Brit music humour mag - with a
         slightly odd page where "Philippa Forester off of
         Tomorrow's World" reviews the latest singles, and implying
         a rather different rumour to the one that we'd heard...
