</span><span class="item">         And cue the Creative Archive! Oh sure, a few people have
         griped about the "no-endorsement" clauses (hey, even the
         mighty copyright-free NASA weakly requests you not to use
         its material to imply United States Starfleet support). And
         there's some real questions over what it means to be UK-only
         (Will the BBC enforce the rule with special GeoIP "detector
         vans" that will roam every street outside Britain? Is the
         BBC motto going to be "Nation Won't Let Nation Touch Its
         Preciousssss"? Or will the original copyright holders
         eventually wise up and see the benefits of inevitable
         worldwide distribution?) But the key promise has been
         preserved: no DRM, and a working demo to test the waters.
         Plus the Open University is on board, leading to potentially
         endless "Look Around You"-style parodies. Also, actual
         content: while nobody seems to have mentioned it, the BFI
         have stepped up to the mark with three CA-licensed works:
         "Silent Hamlet" (clearly some classic anime episode), "Looks
         very jolly, doesn't it?" (would work great in a video remix
         of Fatboy Slim's "Praise You"), and "Our New Errand Boy".
         Which, presumably, is some sort of ad for BitTorrent.

         over, CHRIS LIGHTFOOT will be mysteriously found to be Prime
         Minister, with the rest of the MySociety hackers in prominent
         cabinet positions? The speed by which they have,
         individually or acting in secret conspiracy, constructed
         fistfuls of election sites, surely hints at some deeper lust
         for power. Their slightly-defensively-domained NOTAPATHETIC
         DOT COM takes your confessions as to why you're not voting
         (we're looking forward to the MP's response site,
         IDONTBLOODYWORKFORYOUTHEN.COM). Lightfoot-hosted,
         party-based "Who Should I Vote For" competes with his
         honourable colleagues' more granualar seven-question quiz at
         Public Whip, which bases its demands on your personal MP's 
         voting patterns. If just one of these sites were rigged to 
         tell you to vote for the CVS party, they could get in with 
         a landslide.

         fine, you're so fine, you rewrite incoming HTML on the fly

         scripts, the script being determined by the URL of the
         original page! Hey Greasemonkey! GM is the premier
         bit-tampering plugin, based on its growing library of
         rewriters, which do locally what the best guerilla usability
         sites did at the server: skin sites, strip ads, de-Flash
         Flickr, grab Salon daily passes, cut out Michael Jackson
         stories from Reuters, and splice Bloglines and Del.icio.us
         together in inhuman ways, and so forth. For those trapped 
         by the Time Wars in the 20th Century, there was briefly
         GREASEMONKIE, which did the same thing for Internet
         Explorer co-dependents. Todd Ostermeier even attempted to
         patch IE's idiosyncratic Javascript library so that
         Firefox-sourced scripts would work unchanged. But now,

         produced tracks with obvious filler material... similarly, it

         "The Fast And The Furious", but with extreme sports instead of 
         racing cars... the British fixation with hobbies that are 
         extremely time-consuming, yet ultimately produce very little,
