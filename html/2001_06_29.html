         required to enter (or even attend) most of the new media 
         awards, we're pleased to announce that we've wangled free 
         entry, including food and booze, for anybody who wants to come 
         and see us fail to win "Internet Journalist Of The Year" for 
         the second time running at the NETMEDIA EUROPEAN ONLINE

         have some idea of numbers). Admittedly, given the number of 
         categories this year - Best News Story Broken on the Net: 
         Utrygge Polseskinn (Unsafe Sausage Skins) - we're not sure how 
         much of a Eurovision-style long-haul it might be but, hey, you 
         can always while away the longer speeches trying to spot your 
         fellow NTK reader-contributors and wondering what else you 
         might have in common with them. Or you might feel we at least 
         owe you a drink for all those funny URLs you sent in that we 
         never credited you for. Or you might require a face-to-face 
         apology for that time we linked to your poorly-publicised 
         personal site, which indirectly led to a number of unfortunate 
         comments being posted in the guestbook about your wife. Either 
         way, hope to see you there!

</span><span class="item">         Q. What is "NTK"?
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         A. NTK began life as a subscription-only newsletter showcasing 
         the very best in highbrow erotic fiction for women. But, as 
         is often the case with those shifting new-economy business 
         models, readers actually found the fictitious "web diary" 
         section (penned by "Susannah", an ambitious country girl 
         yearning to make it in the glamorous world of new media) 
         far more convincing than the various odysseys of personal 
         self-exploration among the Parisian demi-monde. One swift 
         relaunch later, NTK as we know it was born. Keen-eyed 
         readers may still spot traces of our shady origins from time 
         to time: sudden lapses into strong language at moments of 
         heightened emotion, for instance, or those uncomfortably 
         detailed accounts of male nudity in current feature films.

</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         A. Basically, anything you find interesting or amusing, and 
         think others might too, especially if it falls under:
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         * Weird stuff brewing in UK newsgroups or discussion boards.
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         * Self-indulgent sniping at The Guardian or The Register (or 
         any other publications of note - but, for some reason, mainly 
         The Guardian or The Register).
</span><span class="item_space">

</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         That said (and without wanting to sound ungrateful), we 
         reserve the right to send back a sarcastic reply to any of 
         the following:
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         * Things we've run before (or, especially annoyingly, things 
         we've run in the last couple of weeks). To check, type a 
         distinctive part of the URL into the search form at the top 
         right of <a href="http://www.ntk.net">http://www.ntk.net</a> , and see if anything comes up. 
         We'll be so glad you did. 
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         * Screengrabs of sites which have been broken for weeks (use

</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         * Obscure e-commerce sites showing obscure products with 
         prices of $0.00 or $99999.99 (though our general disclaimer

         this and all subsequent categories).
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         * E-commerce sites where the release date of a book or CD is 
         listed as 1900, or similar hilarity. 
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         * Pics of Microsoft servers falling over (these now have to be 
         almost *life-threateningly* ironic to get in...)
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         * Photos of Windows crashing on big TV screens in public 
         places, especially ones you found on someone else's website.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         AND CLARIFICATIONS" COLUMN IN THE UK&gt;&gt; apparently we confused 
         "cryogenics" with "cryonics" in our 2001-06-01 profile of H 
         Keith Henson; an individual claiming to be Jon Ronson mailed, 
         apropos of nothing we can remember, to say "Leave me alone you 
         bastards"; but far more distressing to us was RICHARD MURKIN's 
         (entirely correct) allegation that, during the course of last 
         week's largely unprovoked "Prob-Bitch" parody newsletter, we 
         made the unsupported assumption that penis size follows a 
         normal distribution within the specified population, in which 
         case the median would be exactly the same as the mean. "If 
         you're looking to establish the first British statistics and 
         celebrity gossip website, you should explain this kind of 
         thing better," chided Richard, "or at least point readers in 
         the direction of a few good papers on the topic" - little 
         realising that other readers were already mailing us research 
         from the field: <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6874/1/1">http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6874/1/1</a> -

         surreal Twin Peaks-style show about morticians which just 
         started on HBO", from the makers of "American Beauty". Either 
         that or "It's *really* subtle meme advertising for AI"... but, 
         as ever, our heftiest mailbag followed NTK 2001-06-01's 
         challenge to find the earliest recorded instance of a computer 
         or video game "entirely set in a vagina". After discarding 
         ALEX ROBINSON's nomination of oddly '80s-themed Flash app 
         <a href="http://www.limmy.com/projects/comeagain/comeagain_popup.htm">http://www.limmy.com/projects/comeagain/comeagain_popup.htm</a>

         unrelated to this contest, for its "Detailed models of Cocks, 
         Balloons, Planes and Cartriges"), we were left with GUY 
         DAVIDSON's suggestion of "Deus Ex Machina" on the Spectrum, 
         "which was at least partially set in [one]". "By the way, 
         where are you now Mr Croucher?", Guy ponders, claiming, "You 
         owe me UKP800 and 17 years' interest..." So, in the end, we 
         felt it should go to the furtive teenage fumblings of BUSTA 
         JAMES, who recalls visiting an American friend in 1988, and 
         being introduced to the Sega Genesis, the internet, and a game 
         where you controlled a sperm-shooting penis. "The only setting 
         I can imagine that to have any relevance in is a lady's 
         delicates," he persuasively argues. "And that is where, I'm 
         almost certain, it was set". No further questions, your honour 
         - NTK regrets that this correspondence is now closed...
