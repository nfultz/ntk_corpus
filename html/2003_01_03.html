         I've got kids and everything but, pretty much every week I 
         read your newsletter from end to end (it's a Sunday evening 
         kind of thing), including (and this is the funny thing) the 
         frankly weird review of new confectionery (and crisps). What's 
         wrong with me? Can you help?

         well, actually I could (that was, he said to clarify the

         of sunlight would be missing.

         "merchandising spin-offs". But, to be honest, the main reason 
         we keep going is that we get such interesting mail - plus the 
         opportunity to reach such desirable opinion-formers as Steve 
         "Webmedia/Another.com" Bowbrick, with news like this year's

</span><span class="item">         [THROUGH MOUTHFUL OF PRINGLES] Hi - Danny here. Now, many of 
         you will have heard of LEE FELSENSTEIN, the Berkeley free 
         speech activist who helped found the Homebrew Computer Club in 
         Silicon Valley (where the Apple was first demo-ed), created 
         the first cheapo modem, hacked up the Osborne 1, and co-
         founded the still-heavily-cloaked Hackers Conference (the 
         place where information first wanted to be free). And what is 
         the original social engineer up to now? Well, at the request 
         of a local charity, he's invented a five-PC, bicycle-powered, 
         ultra-cheap Linux network that will let remote villages in 
         Laos (between Thailand and Vietnam) connect with the local 
         market town via WiFi, and thence onto the Net. But they're 
         having problems convincing their sponsors that they'll be able 
         to get it working before the monsoon. So they're going to 
         scratch the money together and do it anyway.

         below, and then consider donating UKP10 of that money your

</span><span class="item">         Q. Have you thought of trying to provide a glossary for those 
         who don't know all your in-terms (like me)? Even when you 
         occasionally explain them, they're soon forgotten and the 
         explanations are hard to re-find: e.g. "Falco", "Meme". I'm 
         left with a dodgy feeling where I think I understand what they 
         mean but don't know the reason/origin.

         to be about, conveniently coinciding with this week's seasonal

         called "Kiss The Girls III: Wee Wee Wee All The Way Home"...

         BONERS: CORRECTIONS, CLARIFICATIONS, AND "INCORRECTLY REGARDED 
</span><span class="geekmedia">         AS GOOFS"&gt;&gt; Q. I spotted a mistake in last week's issue. 
         Should I tell you about it?
         
         A. Yes, please do. If we make a mistake, we tend to get a lot 
         of mail about it, usually in the form of amusingly sarcastic 
         comments - and, if we're lucky, screenshots of our own website 
         captioned "How about this for your doh section, guys? Hahaha!"
         
         Much as we look forward to these moment of public humiliation, 
         we may not always have time to reply to all contributors. And 
         if we do, we are sometimes regrettably short. On that note, 
         well done to readers FRANK ARNAUD, JAMES METHLEY, ANDREW 
         MORLEY, DOUGLAS YATES, SIMON "AM I THE THOUSANDTH PERSON TO 
         POINT THIS OUT?" PARSONS, ROGER SAN MATERO, and IAN TRUSKETT 
         who contested last week's answer that the YYYY-MM-DD format had 
         "no precedent in established practice anywhere in the world" - 
         when apparently it's very much in vogue in those notoriously 
         depopulated nations of China and Japan. How about that for our 
         doh section, eh? Hahaha!... a similar crowd commented on the 
         issue of 2002-11-22 apparently providing "Tomorrow's news, 
         today!", due to being datestamped from 24 hours in the future. 
         But crypto-activist RICHARD CLAYTON was the first to astutely 
         diagnose this as a side-effect of that issue's command to "set 
         your clock to 23:59" in order to see all the numbers flip 
         over: <a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02002-11-22&amp;l=174#l">http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02002-11-22&amp;l=174#l</a> ... 
         OWEN BLACKER incorrectly regarded us as goofs when he wrote to 
         rectify NTK 2002-12-13's attribution of the Requiem For A 
         Dream/ Two Towers trailer theme to one "Clint Poppie" - "I 
         think you'll find that's Clint Mansell (and played by the 
         Kronos Quartet)", he preened, continuing to maintain that the 
         track is "credited to Clint Mansell" even after we pointed out 
         that "Mansell" (and not "Vestan Pance") is actually Clint 
         Poppie's real name! And finally, JOHN HOLLINGUM provided a 
         timely reminder of why this is called the "Boners" section by 
         bashing NTK's 2002-10-04 correction of the quote from a 
         search-engine optimiser, which we reported as: "Google's 
         penalty literally took food out of my families mouth". As John 
         noted, the original comment identified that it was Google's 
         "penality" (sic) which "literally took food out of [his] 
         families mouth" - a mental image which, although it isn't 
         technically a synonym for "penis", certainly gave him 
         something to "snigger about". NTK regrets the non-error and 
         any absence of double-entendre it may have caused...
