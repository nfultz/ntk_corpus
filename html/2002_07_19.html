</span><span class="item">         On July 17th, 2001, DMITRY SKLYAROV, coder for the Russian
         software house ELCOMSOFT, was arrested while visiting the
         US. His crime: writing code that exposed flaws in Adobe's
         e-book security, in contravention of the USA's exciting new
         DMCA. In the next year, thanks to widespread protests, Adobe
         withdrew their call to prosecute the Russian hacker and
         Dmitry was freed. Elcomsoft is still in the dock for
         breaching Adobe's copy restriction routines. If the aim of
         the prosecution was to cow them into keeping quiet about
         security problems, it doesn't appear to have worked. On July
         12th, 2002, ELCOMSOFT posted to Bugtraq a flaw in Adobe's
         e-book security. Namely, that in Adobe's "lending library"
         web app for the Adobe Content Server, you can borrow a book
         for over twenty years (instead of three days) just by
         changing a hidden Web form value. The library site is just a
         demonstration app, so it's not a serious problem, but it
         does give Elcomsoft room for a catty little addendum. "Some
         time ago", they write "we have found much more serious
         problem with another Adobe software and reported it to the
         vendor; however, there was no response at all, and so we
         decided not to waste our time reporting this one (about the
         library) to Adobe". How much reaction do they want?
         Salt sown in the soil of Moscow and the Volga canal aflame?

</span><span class="item">         We'll tread cautiously with this one, as it involves Vast
         Ageless Corporations Who Have Retained Counsel Living Where
         Their Glowing Eyesockets Used To Be. Just days before we
         read on Slashdot that zombie company FORGENT is demanding
         patent license fees for users of JPEG, we're contacted by
         someone who has received a similiarly threatening letter -
         this time, from the rather more established Lucent
         Technologies. The message reads: "After some market research
         it has come to our attention that some of your company's
         products may employ the JBIG/JPEG Standard. Therefore,
         Lucent Technologies GRL LLC, Lucent's licensing agent, is
         contacting your company regarding your interest in obtaining
         a license for patents." What follows is the usual demand for
         fees, dire threats if compliance is thwarted, requests that
         the guards seize the criminals and throw them in Patent
         Dungeon, etc. Now, Lucent's patents don't seem to be
         breached by a JPEG implementaton (although it's known that
         JBIG is patent-encumbered; hence JBIG-2). So why does Lucent
         bring up JPEG at all? A curious wording for sure, and we'd
         be interested to see if anyone else has been contacted in
         these terms. Mail us at tips@spesh.com if you have.

         2002? Joy! Hidden among the usual suspects - which include
         Richard Dawkins ("scientist"), Kevin Warwick ("scientist"),
         Kevin Eldon ("comedian" - and KING OF HOBBIES), is one
         Charlie Brooker (listed here as a "TV Go Home"). Merely
         appearing in the list seems to have prompted the reclusive,
         unsmiling, and often violent comedian to hurredly post a
         TVGoHome update from his pile of cardboard boxes near Soho,
         which is all to the good. But does he really deserve the title?
         What *is* sharpness? "In case your are [sic] in any doubt",
         the site explains, "sharpness is, above all, an attitude". Now
         the dictionary says it's also "having a bitter taste", and
         "harshness of manner", and given that Hank, the Angry
         Drunken Dwarf is both unlisted and dead, we think Brooker's
         a show-in for the Web protest/mess-with-publisher's-heads
         vote. We urge you to vote now, express the will of the
         people, and win some vile perfume or a horrible watch.

         naturel" without any kind of intervening moderation system.
         And yet, at the same time, we cannot look away. 7pm local
         time, Thu 2002-07-25 marks the world's first SLASHDOT MEETUP
         EVENT (check local listings for details, free), attracting -
         at time of writing - an impressive 91 interested signups for
         the London gathering (19 for Manchester, Leeds 17, Glasgow 11,
         Birmingham 9, Liverpool 6, and so on). Usual warnings about
         meeting your online "friends" are, we imagine, more than
         usually applicable here - especially as no-one can work out
         what the organisers are getting out of it. Spamming lists?
         Kickbacks from the democratically selected venues? Or valuable

</span><span class="item">         Once again that silly 5K Web competition thing gets the
         headlines. And once again, we must rub its fatty, fatty chin
         against the honed shard of flint that is the 2002 1K
         MINIGAME 8-BIT CODING COMPETITION until it's shaved meek.
         1024 bytes is all you (must have) wrote: to enter, arrange
         them to form a working game on any 8-bit micro you choose.
         In response to complaints from last year, "middle class BBC
         Micro Fauntleroys" will be permitted, says last year's
         judge, Matt Westcott. More weakness is shown by permitting
         Atari 2600s, which have 2K cartridges, to enter (you must
         fill the last 1K with zeros), and also the TI99/4A which as
         everyone knows has sixteen bits. We do hope this doesn't end
         in Zork virtual machines or Postscript or something.

         SCHOOL (5pm, Fri, BBC1) and redecorating their homes in HOME
         ON THEIR OWN (7pm, Sat, ITV), we can't wait for the concept
         gameshows where they fly planes, run pubs and perform
         lifesaving surgery... Wired UK's Hari Kunzru reappears on
         NEWSNIGHT REVIEW (11pm, Fri, BBC2)... and if you like James
         "Copland" Mangold's sensitive character study of an overweight
         man HEAVY (1.05am, Fri, BBC2), the IMDB also recommends Eddie
         Murphy's "The Nutty Professor"... The Beach Boys' "Pet Sounds"
         is the subject of ART THAT SHOOK THE WORLD (7.20pm, Sat,
         BBC2), even though it doesn't have "Good Vibrations" on it...
         Meg Ryan experiments with setting a romantic comedy during the
         Gulf War, and where one of the protagonists is dead, in
         COURAGE UNDER FIRE (9.15pm, Sat, BBC1)... but we'd skip that -
         along with laboured Tim Burton homage MARS ATTACKS! (10.35pm,
         Sat, ITV) - in favour of Ensign Ro and Kevin Spacey - together
         at last! - in top-notch low-budget office horror SWIMMING WITH
         SHARKS (10.50pm, Sat, C5)... Radha "Pitch Black" Mitchell
         shows up in Aussie relo-drama LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES
         (1.05am, Sat, BBC2)... Matt "Max Headroom" Frewer fails to
         halt the downward slide of the "National Lampoon" franchise in
         Washington excursion NATIONAL LAMPOON'S SENIOR TRIP (12.30am,
         Sat, ITV), compared to acknowledged classics like NATIONAL
         LAMPOON'S VACATION (9pm, Tue, C5)... the final of JUNKYARD
         WARS (8pm, Mon, C4) offers a taste of where these shows are
         going when the teams must build full-size remote-controlled
         "combat cars"... while a "I Preferred The Terrorism Of The
         1980s" special recreates the SAS - EMBASSY SIEGE (9pm, Thu,
         BBC2) - if only everything was as simple as pseudo-'70s

         acquired tang of DIET COKE LEMON, reader WAYNE WILLIAMS has
         been forced to look further afield for his acidic thrills,
         proclaiming the "Citrus" version of ROWNTREE'S FRUITSOME
         CEREAL BARS "pretty tasty, a bit like a lemon meringue pie in
         a bar". Frankly we preferred the "Tropical" and "Red Berry"
         variants, though neither as much as the various ALPEN BARS
         with "yoghurt" or "chocolate" style toppings - and all for
         just twice the fat of ordinary breakfast cereal! In other
         most-important-meal-of-the-day news, those eggy "breakfast
         pizza" CHICAGO TOWN SCRAMBLES [NTK 2002-04-12] are delicious
         (particularly with tomato ketchup), and have been flying off
         the shelves in a 2-pack for 99p deal in selected branches of
         Sainsbury's... as predicted in NTK 2001-08-10, KFC have taken
         advantage of MCDONALD'S weakness in the KITKAT MCFLURRY arena,
         and rolled out their identically-sized rival AVALANCHE (also
         99p) with a freakish selection of toppings including chocolate
         sauce, Cadbury's Flake, M&amp;M's and Starburst Joosters. In a
         non-ice-cream-related incident, CHARLOTTE LATIMER was the
         first to contact us with a sighting of STARBURST "straight-
         out-of-the-1993-naming-dept" FLIPSTERS HARD CANDY (from
         30p/pack): "pretty nice hard candies (peach, apple, raspberry
         and forest fruits) with a yucky plastic-looking splodge on one
         side that purports to offer some kind of creaminess (we
         guess)", but still no news yet of the brand's other mutant
         offspring: teardrop-shaped FRUITINESSE (from 49p), non-fish-
         flavoured gummy SEA MONSTERS (from 99p/bag), and STARBURST
         CAKE BARS (UKP1.05 for pack of 5)... and finally, MIKE WALSH
         of Finland remained nonplussed with last month's UK sighting
         of an imported South African NESTLE SMARTIES IN MILKYBAR
         CHOCOLATE, maintaining he bought a White "Ritter Sport" bar
         with Smarties in, "in a branch of the (German) Spar chain in
         Tenerife in January", and was generally disappointed by its
         usability: "Smarties kept falling out", he complains. But
         Nestle is innovating over here as well, with the imminent
         arrival of WONKA XPLODER and GOLDEN CRUNCHER biscuits (79p/
         pack of 6) - replacing underperforming former NTK "Taste
         Abominations" WONKA OOMPA sweets - and its first new chocolate
         launch in 5 years, solid-looking would-be Dairy Milk-killer
         NESTLE DOUBLE CREAM (40p, available from July 29)...
