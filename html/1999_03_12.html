</span><span class="item">         Well, a third of the time to help the DTI invent an
         alternative to key escrow has passed already, and here's our
         top 5 suggestions for "meeting law enforcement requirements":
         5. A voluntary PICS-style "criminality" rating which users
         put on their own emails, ranging from "1 - harmless" and "2 -
         mildly subversive" to "4 - felony in progress". 4. A Babylon
         5-esque "Psi-corps" of telepathic sensitives to extract
         crypto keys directly from crooks' minds. 3. Foster perfect
         socialist utopia, thus rendering concept of secrecy moot. 2.
         Alternative to "Key escrow"? How about "No key escrow!"
         (hehehe). and: 1. Hire that kid from Mercury Rising, or any
         movie hacker that has ever said "the files are encrypted, it
         might take me a few minutes...". Impressively, Tim Pearson,
         head of the UK's INTERNET SERVICES PROVIDERS ASSOCIATION, has
         pinned his hopes on that last option, according to a story on
         Fox News - "it is unlikely criminals are going to... use
         licensed encryption companies," says Tim (rightly), "so the
         only alternative is to get at the messages once their PC has
         unraveled them". In other words: hack into them while they're
         still online. We're not convinced the commercial and civil
         rights lobbies are actually going to prefer this over key
         escrow - but our objection is a little more succint: isn't
         this what we already pay GCHQ to do?

</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         In October 1997 British physicist LAURENCE GODFREY sued
         Canadian student Michael Dolenga (then at Cornell University)
         for libelling him online in 1995. Mr Godfrey is also suing
         Demon for not removing allegedly forged messages appearing to
         be from him on soc.culture.thai. We haven't heard anything on
         the Demon one yet, but a UK court ruled against Dolenga last
         week, ordering him to pay UKP15,000 in damages. Clearly an
         important precedent in cross-border cyber-disputes etc etc,
         right down to the fact that the Canadian authorities may not
         enforce the judgement: "I'm not recognizing the British
         court's jurisdiction and the hell with it", Dolenga
         explained. It hasn't calmed the newsgroups down either: a
         posting on the matter to soc.culture.canada makes remarkable
         use of the phrases "Blow it out your ass", "Fuck off, eh!",
         and "Smack you upside the head with a hockey stick".

</span><span class="item">         Kieslowski... Kurosawa... and now STANLEY KUBRICK. Not a
         great time to be a cult director whose surname begins with a
         "K" but other so-called "coincidences" have had film fans'
         conspiracy meters twitching. Guardian Unlimited mis-spelled
         his surname (the usual sign that someone's faked their death
         to enjoy Elvis-like seclusion), all traces of former "work in
         progress" Artificial Intelligence were swiftly erased from
         imdb.com (just like it never existed), and the timing is,
         frankly, a bit coincidental (just before the release of Eyes
         Wide Shut footage, and the rumoured dispute between Kubrick
         and Warner Bros over its release date). Of course, all the
         obituaries stress "natural causes" and Stan's good
         relationship with his studio, so some theories are weirder
         than others: Clockwork Orange-obsessed fans trying to secure
         a UK release? A HAL-influenced face-off with an on-set
         mainframe?

</span><span class="item">         Many of our readers have children, though we're not sure how
         (Asexual mitosis? Repeated viewings of Weird Science?). But
         true nerd parents will understand the lesson of Davros,
         creator of the Daleks: how can one enforce geek values into
         your "next generation" technology? Well, while you made do
         with discrete Logo, Lego and BASIC components, the whole
         experience is now integrated into Ken Kahn's TOONTALK - a
         visual object-oriented concurrent constraint logic
         programming language, implemented in a virtual Lego world
         using animated robots (functions), buildings (objects), birds
         and nests (messages), trucks (actor spawning), bombs, and a
         little mouse that hits things with a hammer. In common with
         most visual languages, I have no way of explaining further
         except by showing you my recursive mandelbrot robot, and
         waving my hands a lot. Toontalk appears to be extensible
         (there's a filing system bird), and accomplished building-
         bird-nest-robot hybrids can be compiled into Java applets.
         Significantly, it exhibits the essential characteristic of a
         larval geek training kit - borderline incomprehensibility to
         any adult. See the look of pity mixed with shame on your
         child's face as you struggle to convert Tinytool's metaphors
         to a "proper programming language". And feel the glow of
         pride on your own. Obsolete, at last.

         among the celebs keeping fixed grins through the 6-hour
         torment of COMIC RELIEF (from 7pm, Fri, BBC1). Highlights may
         include Rowan Atkinson and Julia Sawalahalaha in a typically
         hard-hitting parody of DR WHO (8pm, 8.30pm, 9.35pm);
         hopefully an inappropriate Rwanda quip or two from ALAN
         PARTRIDGE LIVE (9pm, BBC2); SIMON MAYO battling sleep-
         deprivation-induced psychosis and hallucinations (could you
         tell?) after 37 hours on air (9.45pm); and some FRENCH AND
         SAUNDERS sketch about child prostitution (10.25pm). HAVE I

         caption "Phill Jupitus" on what is surely a picture of Meat
         Loaf - and listen up, radio fans: when former Richard Curtis
         girlfriend (and Bridget Jones inventor) Helen Fielding
         appeared on A BUNCH OF RED NOSES (9pm, last Tue, Radio 2),
         did she mention that she took the piss out of the whole
         business in her earlier, funnier novel "Cause Celeb"?...
         BBC2's Vegas day (from 1.50pm, Sat, BBC2), featuring rare,
         good Elvis film VIVA LAS VEGAS (3.15pm), even infects a new
         Simpsons episode "Viva Ned Flanders" (6.30pm, Sun, SkyOne)...

         bill WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING (9.05pm, Sat) then Dennis Leary
         co-creation STOLEN HEARTS (11.10pm)... no-one let Spielberg
         near romance *or* comedy after the appalling 1941 (12.50am,
         Sun, some ITV)... Peter "Truman Show" Weir shows a bit more
         bite in semi-Mad-Max THE CARS THAT ATE PARIS (12.10am, Sun,
         BBC1)... and forget ITV ditching News At 10 for Bond films:
         C5 drops its 7pm News in favour of from-the-start reruns of
         classic crimebusting Hasselhoff vehicle KNIGHT RIDER (7pm,
         Mon-Fri ) - talking car meant less dialogue for non-acting
         lead... yup, last week's wasn't the last of this lot of X

         THE LARRY SANDERS SHOW (11.35pm, Tue, BBC2) and penultimate
         clip-show SEINFELD (10pm, Mon, SkyOne)... TOMORROW'S WORLD

         mysteries of memory, beauty, and the human mind - and to
         write a pop song about it online... first and best of the
         Dirty Harry sequels MAGNUM FORCE (9.35pm, Thu, C5) features
         Lalo Schifrin theme, as covered by Pop Will Eat Itself on
         their "92 Degrees" 12-inch... while HORIZON (9.30pm, Thu,

         it's an even schmaltzier "Live Patients Society", with a
         rather selective "true story" basis: whatever the real Adams
         was expelled from medical school for, it wasn't "excessive
         happiness"; last year he was accused of mismanaging funds for
         his Gesundheit Institute (Entertainment Weekly, 1999-01-15,
         p7)... SFW's Reese Witherspoon, Tobey Maguire are reunited in

         oddly oversweetened... the world hasn't gone completely mad,

         packed chocolate covered cake snack in bite size portions"

         an expensive failure, ICELAND'S in-store "Feel The Deal"
         posters will invite customers to "eat what they want and give
         the empty wrapper in at the till", and seen in TESCO: "St
         Patrick's Day March 17th" - on a display of Heinz spaghetti
         in tomato sauce... penetration of SPACE DUST continues into
         all sectors, with SAINSBURY'S CUSTARD DELIGHT WITH POPPING
         SPACE ROCKS (59p), followed by upcoming NESTLE ZOOM lolly
         going up against the TREBOR REFRESHERS fizzy fruity milk ice
         (35p)... in direct contravention of the laws of nature
         outlined in Soda Stream instructions, two new "fizzy milk"
         drinks have the UK tingling: EHRMANN'S ALMI DRINK - believed
         to be Germany's first carbonated yoghurt drink (blended with
         apple juice); and the Swiss RIVELLA - a slightly sparkling
         herb-flavoured Lucozade-alike "based on milk serum"
         (43p/can). Just don't pour them on JURASSIC BREAKFAST:

         to NESTLE MAXI-MOOZE (6 tubes of condensed milk "Bursting
         with Energy", ie 28.2g of sugar per 50g total: "I've taken to
         carrying a couple of these around in my pockets for a quick
         sugar fix when out and about") - instead of the "more
         ambitious" MINI-MOOZE (12 x 35g packs of fluid with curious
         strawberry, vanilla and chocolate flavours). Haven't been
         able to replicate this ourselves, largely due to difficulties
         finding them in Sainsbury's: would they be with the ONKEN
         FRUFOO FORMAGE FRAIS (now comes with "six collectable
         chicks", a direct competitor to Anchor SoSoft's "small cuddly
         cows") - or the NESTLE SQUIZZO'S?...
