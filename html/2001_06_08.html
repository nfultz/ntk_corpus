</span><span class="item">         Just what is the connection between the Guardian/Observer
         and dotcom no-hoper MOONFRUIT? The relationship dates back
         to 2000-01-20, when the Guardian ran a gushy day-in-the-life
         piece on the company. Entirely coincidentally, the piece was
         written by a Moonfruit employee, Justin "others have
         questioned my independence" Hunt. Justin's cut-and-paste
         from Moonfruit's pitch revealed that they would be "using
         the latest Flash-based technology": sufficient in itself to
         invoke the Tuneless Clank of Death in readers' ears. In
         April, a happy-clappy lifestyle piece in the same paper
         quoted heavily from the fruit's employees: "If commitment
         alone were enough Moonfruit - which has just secured its
         first revenue deal - would be massive". Sadly, though, being
         committed only helps in breaking into the psychiatric
         market, and by April 2001, the Guardian was writing more
         muted pieces, speaking only of the "arguable success" of
         Moonfruit.com, and mentioning that its "hyped" CEO Wendy Tan
         was trying to sell the thing off. If Wendy Tan was hyped, it
         was surely due to the Guardian and Observer: according to
         the FT's Global Archive, over half of the articles
         mentioning were from these two papers. This week, though,
         was the final straw: a piece which, once again, interviewed
         practically the entire Moonfruit founding team, this time
         asking them about their nice new jobs, given that MF has now
         sacked all but seven of its employees. But even *now*, the
         Observer is still including heavy-handed plugs for the
         company: "we were offering something they didn't know they
         wanted... whoever buys Moonfruit will be able to tap into
         that". Which leaves the question: who at the Grauniad
         management bought so heavily into this one-trick pony that
         they're *still* trying to flog it?

         - In the words of Austin Powers: WHY WON'T YOU DIE?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         And so farewell, ORBS, the New Zealand anti-spam blackhole
         list, whose utter paranoia proved both a selling point and a
         (literal) liability. It's still not entirely clear why
         maintainer Alan Brown decided to kill it - although the
         civil suit against him in NZ by companies included on the
         list, and his decision this month to sell his ISP and quit
         the whole Net biz altogether might have *something* to do
         with it. Of course, ORBS has died before, to be reborn -
         Alan B. only picked up managing the service when previous
         operator, Alan Hodgson at Dorkslayers, threw in the towel.
         Now it looks like the former Alan has been playing around
         with restarting the service (although only for non-USA
         servers). And what's this? Mirrors of the complete ORBS
         blacklist, ready for someone else to take up the baton?

         protest outside the Canadian High Commission in Grosvenor
         Square tomorrow (or the day before yesterday, if you're
         reading this on Monday) at 1300BST. A prior meet will
         commence, in true British demo fashion, at the Marlborough
         Head pub, 24 North Audley Street, London, at noon. Of
         course, many anti-scientologists can be as, uh, enthusiastic
         as the most proselytising hubbardista, but we're sure
         there'll be plenty of room for everyone. If it gets too
         weird, or they start teargassing everyone, say you're
         nothing to do with the "manimals" and act like you're

         ART DROIDS 2000AD, a small but perfectly formed display of
         original artwork from the anachronistically named Brit sci-fi
         comic of the same name (level 2, Henry Cole Wing, Victoria and
         Albert Museum, London SW7, UKP5 to get into museum, free after
         4.30pm). Curator Rufus Dayglo is obviously a fan of scratchy
         old Mike McMahon (or friends with him or something), but the
         distinctive penmanship of Carlos "Strontium Dog" Ezquerra and
         Dave "Rogue Trooper" Gibbons also gets a look in, and there's
         an early full-colour Dredd story in which the "space vampire"
         is clearly painted on using Tippex. Almost unforgiveably,
         there's no Kevin O'Neill, though it is just next door to the
         Frank Lloyd Wright exhibit, where you can recite your
         favourite lines from "Blade Runner" against an authentic
         interior design setting.

         time with Windows' premier Spectrum Tape Loading Simulation
         Screensaver, SCREEN$. Directly addressing the common emulator
         failing that a) they don't usually do the exciting line-by-
         line rasterisation of the loading screen, topped off with the
         clumsy "reveal" of the attributes file; and b) the games then
         turn out to be rubbish, SCREEN$ focuses exclusively on the
         loading screen element, painstakingly constructing one of 200
         popular ZX title images, accompanied by authentic real-time
         sound effects, then giving up and loading another one. What's
         more, it even crashes with convincingly depressing regularity,
         presumably part of a "forgetting to blu-tak your Kempston
         joystick interface edge connector" emulation feature.

         UK bestsellers, now updated at <a href="http://www.ntk.net/books/">http://www.ntk.net/books/</a> . The

         both THE KINKS and ORSON WELLES - right up to his largely
         unheralded vocal performance in TRANSFORMERS: THE MOVIE.
         Bookwise, a recent surge by Thomas Pynchon and various guides
         to Dinky toys have failed to unseat the ever-popular NEAL
         STEPHENSON, though reader LLOYD WOOD was quick to point out
