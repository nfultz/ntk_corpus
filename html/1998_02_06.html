</span><span class="item">         Yet another glorious week for BILL GATES. Taking a break
         from the trouble in his home country, he visited the Swiss
         skiing resort of DAVOS (site of the World Economic Summit,
         and home of the Creator of the Daleks), where he was feted
         as a leading entrepreneur. His company was voted "Most
         Respected Company Operating In Europe Irrespective Of
         Country Of Origin" by the FT and Price Waterhouse. His
         lawyers managed to get Special Master (and Mac lover)
         Lawrence Lessig thrown off the DOJ case. Rumours that
         Netscape were about to bought up were rife. Internet
         Explorer overtook Navigator in Japan. What, he thought, as
         he strode breezily into yet another high-powered meeting
         with Belgian business leaders, could possibly go wrong now?

</span><span class="item">         Last week, the US government released a report on domain
         names that indicated that the plans made by leading Net
         founding fathers to move the domain name servers from
         InterNIC to Switzerland might not happen. This pleased
         groups who thought that these Net elders - principally the
         old hands at the Internet Society - might have too much
         power if they could control where the servers were put.
         Meanwhile, the day before, one of said elders, Jon Postel,
         went a little, er, "postal" and moved the servers anyway -
         over to his home machines at the University of Southern
         California. Postel said later he had wanted to see what
         problems would arise from such a move, and anyway, he put
         the servers straight back, so what's the problem? Ira
         Magaziner, the government figure in charge of the new
         proposals, was quick to forgive Postel, asking critics to
         cut him "some slack". Reports that Postel had suggested
         that he might "accidentally misplace" the Net next time
         remain unconfirmed.

         HTMLed home pages? LYCOS (the George Harrison of search
         engines) bought up TRIPOD (the Ringo Starr of Geocities
         clones) for $58 million this week - about forty dollars for
         every slacker ass the GenX community hosts. A quick search
         on AltaVista reveals "58 million" to be the predicted value
         of the entire Java market in 1997, the loss made by
         Compuserve in the last quarter of 96, and the total number

         multimedia crowd backslapping each other over art-wank
         CDROMs that then go on to sell *no copies at all*. For the
         first time, they're officially recognising the games sector
         (aka the multimedia that sometimes even makes money), with
         noted has-beens like Sid Meier, John Romero, Richard
         Garriott and (yawn) Peter Molyneux. And second, they claim
         to be running a Scandinavian-style Demo Party, with cash
         contests for teen-hacker teams and their "Mixed Demos"
         (includes PC 4K executables), "Musical Scores", "Bitmap
         Graphiques" and, er, "Navigation Interfaces". Sadly, the
         compos start and end with a "cocktail party", kind of

         motto "Demo or Die!" next Wednesday at 7.30pm. Danny
         writes, exclusively for NTK: "This is a bloody nightmare. I
         thought I'd have worked out something for this by now. I've
         had 6 months to think about it, and now it's Friday, and

</span><span class="item">         Adobe Pagemill 3.0 is available for a preview playaround.
         Pagemill was one of the first Web page editors, back before
         everyone went back to doing it in Notepad or BBEdit. New
         features include DHTML support, an "advanced search and
         replace" (wooo!) and "dozens" more improvements (that'll be
         bug fixes, then). Despite its origin, this preview is only
         available for PCs. Nothing for those Photoshop-loving Macs.

         Worldlie Howard Stableford in the 100-minute mathfest of
         OPEN SATURDAY (9am, Sat, BBC2), with the Morlock-like
         Professor Ian Stewart setting puzzles for the unwary...
         cameoing Bob Monkhouse puts on a few pounds - presumably
         just to keep up with the other characters - in JONATHAN
         CREEK (9pm, Sat, BBC1)... classical music series YO-YO MA:
         INSPIRED BY BACH (6.05pm, Sun, BBC2; also 8.05pm, Sat)
         sticks the international violinist among 3D-rendered 18th
         century architecture - intriguing competition for MICHAEL
         BARRYMORE'S MY KIND OF MUSIC (6.30pm, Sun, ITV)... and we
         still think the Sega light-gun coin-op is substantially
         more fun than Spielberg's plodding JURASSIC PARK (7pm, Sun,
         BBC1)... a "mirror writer" (Mon) and rocket builder (Thu)
         are the non-sporting prodigies paraded as RAW TALENT
         (7.55pm, Mon-Thu, C4)... it's no interviewers, no voice-
         over, no kidding in the (As-Seen-On-TV-style?) accounts of
         CHILDREN OF DIVORCE (9.30pm, Mon, BBC2)... Claire Grogan
         spoofs Sinead O'Connor while the priests judge the "Lovely
         Girls" contest in funny-as-ever repeated FATHER TED
         (10.55pm, Mon, C4)... building their strength up for their
         TV return next week, old pals Lee and Herring tuck into Mel
         and Sue's LIGHT LUNCH (12.30pm, Tue, C4)... schoolyard
         "internet problems" hit HEARTBREAK HIGH (6.15pm, Tue,
         BBC2)... the 15 minutes of futuristic penal colony
         performance art in EXPANDING PICTURES (11.45pm, Tue, BBC2)
         sound like a very long sentence indeed... oddly, Abel
         Ferrara's BODY SNATCHERS (10pm, Tue, C4) is but a pale
         imitation of the '70s remake, despite Gabrielle "Press
         Gang" Anwar and borrowing the squealing pig noise... for
         some reason (upcoming censorship?), they're now reshowing
         REBOOT (4.45pm, Thu, ITV) from the end of series 2... and
         the best line in the Forrest-Gumpy Trials And Tribble-
         ations timewarp episode of STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE NINE (6pm,
         Thu, BBC2) goes to Geordi LaForge: "Those are *Klingons*?"

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES&gt;&gt; cinema's first "gay comedy" (unlike, say, The
         Birdcage), IN AND OUT was last-minute postponed last week -
         to avoid facing the still-massive Titanic, and not because
         the idea of a gay Kevin Kline would have confused audiences
         for the Sigourney Weaver/ Christina Ricci supercooled pot-
         boiler THE ICE STORM (imdb: drama / marital-crisis /
         dysfunction / drugs / adultery / based-on-novel / affair-
         extramarital / sexuality / sexual / storm / 1970s /
         waterbed / alcohol / electrocution / family / key-party)...
         Disney remade The Absent Minded Professor as FLUBBER (imdb:
         comedy / based-on-adaptation), yet weirdly forget to put
         any decent gags in, or not to cast Robin Williams...
         another laugh-a-minute Thomas Hardy adaptation in THE
         WOODLANDERS (imdb: drama / based-on-novel / costume), with
         Emily Woof - the pregnant girl off the cellphone ad -
         tragically falling for bloke with a 1970s footballers'
         perm... and a typically dark Gallic soiree in CLUBBED TO
         DEATH (LOLA) (imdb: French) - Beatrice Dalle? Beatrice

</span><span class="geekmedia">         GLOSS&gt;&gt; the semi-Australian "21st Century culture" mag 21C
         was shaping up to be the legible Mondo 2000, but now it's
         taken its emulation perhaps a step too far and ceased
         publication altogether... still, arguably a better fate
         than actually being taken over by RU Sirius, as seems to
         have befallen music-and-fashion cyber-nonsense AXCESS...
         other recent casualties include the second incarnation of
         the frankly hilarious SPY, a closure ominously presaged by
         regular readers' letters bemoaning their inability to
         understand its urbane New York witticisms... on a more
         upbeat note (just), aspiring Net journo Garret Keogh
         informs us that Flamingo ("VNU's answer to Stuff magazine")
         is the code name for new launch COMPUTER ACTIVE, due out
         any day now and apparently helmed by Jan Howells, formerly
         of Ziff-Davis's doomed Computer Life... new cover of SPIN
         features South Park's Eric Cartman, Janet Jackson-style,
         and hopefully gives info on the filthy animators' upcoming
         feature film... back over here, .NET has caught up with
         South Park (p21), but then goes and spoils it all with a
         profile of its 3 top female Quake players, all from the US
         (p74), and an insufficiently detailed apology about the
         "barrage of offensive email" sent to subscribers of the
         hacked netmag-news mailing list (p90)... and finally, RADIO
         TIMES continues its very public struggle with font
         substitution errors - that is, unless they *want* those
         subheads printed in tightly tracked Courier (p8, p133)...
         and this week runs a complaint from one of Britain's
         biggest slash fans - <a href="http://www.hermit.org/Blakes7/">www.hermit.org/Blakes7/</a> - about "plot
         holes" in the recent Blake's 7 radio play (p128);
         presumably not enough "Beat Up And Rape Avon" scenes for
         their liking...
