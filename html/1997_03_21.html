</span><span class="item">         It's okay! Calm, calm. It's me, Dan O'Brien, and I'm
         conducting a small experiment on behalf of humanity.
         About a fortnight ago, we were kicking around a few
         ideas at Need To Know HQ, and decided that what we'd
         love is a WEEKLY E-MAIL NEWSHEET that included a
         summary of the more interesting of the weeks' tech
         media, pointed up nodules of info that perhaps we
         would have missed, kept us up to date with the
         general UK net scene, and included a few cranky
         selections of what we liked to call entertainment.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         This is not that newsheet. However, it is an alpha
         version of that newsheet. It's got all the bits that
         I hope NTK-now could carry: certainly enough to give
         you, dear reader, the idea. Now, all it needs is
         your passive support. Would you want to receive this
         newsletter? Do you think we should carry on? Would
         you be interested in contributing titbits, even?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         If your response to any of the above was 'Well, I
         dunno', please read on. There's more idle chat at
         the end of the 'sheet'.

</span><span class="item">         APPLE'S WOES continued as it announced that 4,100
         employees are to lose their jobs. This represents a
         third of Apple's workforce and is only the latest in
         a series of lay-offs by the company. Apple Chairman
         GIL AMELIO also announced the cancellation of Mac
         projects including OpenDoc, Open Transport, the
         Cyberdog Web browser, and the MacOS development
         tools. Amelio said "We're getting back to basics."
         Heard *that* before.

</span><span class="item">         ISPs and others running USENET NEWS SERVERS on their
         machines were the victim of an ongoing HACKING
         ATTEMPT, as rogue newsgroup control postings were
         used to steal password files and other confidential
         info. The control posts exploited a known security
         hole in an old version of INN, the freely available
         news server package. As the postings spread, they
         attack more and more machines. CERT (the Computer
         Emergency Response Team) report that over a hundred
         machines have fallen victim so far.

</span><span class="item">         Visitors to BT.NET and SUCK.COM got 'site not found'
         this week, as NETWORK SOLUTIONS' crackdown on DOMAIN
         REGISTRATION DEBTS got nasty. Network Solutions, who
         run the Internet's central registry for .com, .edu,
         .gov, .net and .org addresses, put 29,000 domains
         names on hold, after final demand notices failed to
         get a reaction. The sites effectively disappeared
         from the Net. BRITISH TELECOM recorded pre-tax
         profits of UKP3,000 million in 1996. Reserving a
         domain name costs $100.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         There's a new INTEL chip in town. The PENTIUM II,
         due for release early in May, is essentially the
         top-o'the-range Pentium Pro with the new MMX
         multimedia extensions jammed in. Chips sampled so
         far clock in at 266 Mhz, but will probably be
         expensive for a while: PC designers will need to
         revamp their motherboards to cope with its new
         shape. AMD, Intel's rival, is due to release a
         similarly specced chip called the K6 at the same
         time: early speed comparisons are said to put the
         chips neck and neck.

         encryption software.

         conditioning by my machines." Watch the Netscape 'N'

         Okay, I'm back. How was that? Frankly, I think that
         'Next week' section needs another look; It's too
         long, badly formatted, and what is this anyway The
         TV Times? And "culture"? Mmm. Great name, guys -

         The news stuff I'm happy with - is it useful? too
         dull? Overall, it's more geeky than I imagined, but
         I think that's due to me knocking this one out on
         pretty much on my own (my cultural attache pal Dave
         is currently dead with a disease). With other
         people's suggestions, it should blend out a bit. It
         certainly seems doable on a weekly basis.

         Talking of missed deadlines, the original plan was
         to release this on Friday morning. I may rejuggle
         this to Friday 3PM allow us to review *next* week's
         weekly mags (which generally arrive on Friday).

         Well. I'm pleased I've managed to get this prop out
         before my period of enforced net.isolation while I
         do  Oblomov. I'm going to take a long break, and
         then come back to this. God will bless you
         thricefold if you send us a quick mail telling me
         what you think, and whether you'd be interested in
         forwarding the odd scrap to NTK-now from time to
         time. We'll do nothing with it until May, at which
         point we hope to burst fully armoured from our own
         heads. Or something.
         Thanks for reading, and do let me know.
         We need to know.
         D. (and D)
