</span><span class="item">         Worried that you don't understand technology enough to see
         what your kids are doing online? Why not solve the problem
         with *more* technology? THE SUNDAY TIMES asked its readers
         to participate in a "unique study" last week - by installing
         a keyboard logger, perusing the logs of their kid's Net
         activities, then filling in a simple questionnaire. "It is
         however important to obtain a true sample of internet
         activity, and not to alert the child to the software and so
         defeat the object of the exercise", the paper advised. Yes,
         this blanket surveillance is for *science*. Well, someone
         should point out that, without consent, WORDWATCHER's
         research breaches the Marketing Research Council's code of
         practice (because let's face it, this *is* just user testing
         for Demetron), standard scientific research ethics, and,
         hey, could be criminally illegal under the RIP Act. Also,
         it's a *FREAKING VISUAL BASIC KEYLOGGER* they're flogging.
         It records *everything* - passwords, credit card details -
         in an easily readable file. In any other context, the press
         would be railing against this as a Evil Hacker's Tool. The
         ST warns that Wordwatcher may cause "friction": they don't
         know the half of it. It could be used to spy on spouses or
         workmates, or installed at cybercafes to harvest passwords.
         It's also *fantastically* badly written: it stores the
         spyer's main password in plaintext, and despite some
         reassuring-looking bleating, can be examined or turned off
         with a minimum of hassle, as one precocious brat has already
         pointed out. Go wild, kids. And when your mum or dad asks
         what happened, sit them down and tell them these important
         lessons: no security in obscurity, and never, *ever*
         download from strangers. Especially the Visual Basic-using ones.

</span><span class="item">         It's JAM ECHELON Day on Sunday, although encouraging a glut
         of e-mails including keywords like "terrorism",
         "biowarfare", "middle east", and "war" does seem a *bit*
         superfluous right now. To lighten the load, we'll keep our
         traditional hand-wringing over Blunkett's new anti-t-rr-r-sm
         provisions to a minimum. Basically, he's "enabling" ISP's
         (and behind the scenes, hinting that it may become
         compulsory) to keep logs of website addresses, mail headers,
         and newsgroup articles read by subscribers, contra the Data
         Protection Act's provisions and the Registrar's
         protestations. We'll see where this one leads: old
         NTK-a-quote Caspar "Kafka" Bowden points out that this is
         pretty much what the National Criminal Intelligence Service
         was haggling for last year, so expect it to seamlessly
         become permanent at some point. Fnord.

</span><span class="item">         Hardware manufacturers never know quite which way to jump over
         copy protection, but rarely do you see this dilemma literally
         played out on their corporate websites. As well as offering
         secure networks which "eliminate the potential for losing
         millions of dollars due to downtime or e-piracy", NOKIA were,
         until recently, playing up the e-piracy potential of their
         Nokia 5510 integrated FM radio MP3 ripper - illustrated by a
         cartoon called "Mongo" who records his favourite songs off the
         radio and his friends' CDs. And then downloads them to his PC,
         his friends' 5510s, and so on. The page was removed this week
         but, at time of writing, the original .gif is still there.
         Still, if "Mongo" means the same sort of thing in Scandinavia,
         maybe they could claim it's actually an *anti*-piracy campaign
         - "Trading MP3s? That's for the mentally handicapped, dude!"

</span><span class="item">         You know how it is - you spend years promoting your non-
         violent brand of direct action anti-capitalism, then a small
         minority goes and steals all the limelight by crashing a
         couple of planes into a building. Undeterred, the UK's annual
         ANARCHIST BOOKFAIR seem determined to reclaim their previous
         anti-globalisation market share with a fancy new venue (Camden
         Centre, Euston Rd, London WC1, from 10am, Sat 2001-10-20,
         free), plus an (admittedly appropriated) corporate slogan -
         "Just do it", and celebrity guests including representatives
         from IndyMedia, the Discordians, and Alice Nutter out of
         Chumbawumba. That said, the "Delroy Lindo" who'll be speaking
         about his harassment by Haringey police appears to be an
         entirely different one to the movie star best known for
         playing law enforcement officers in films like "Ransom" and
         "Gone In 60 Seconds", though the "Adam Porter" who now runs
         YEAR ZERO magazine *does* appear to be the same guy who used
         to edit the famously radical website for "Loaded" online.

         goes at each tottering step, the original BRIDGE BUILDER was
         great. You got a closed 2D surface, with a riverbank on each
         side. You clicked up a bridge out of girders, watch it fall
         under its own weight, then fiddled and fiddled until it
         stood the stress test of a train crossing. It felt very
         intellectual, and now it's peerrrty too: PONTIFEX, the 3D
         sequel is here. Of course, the openGLy stuff is all just
         "SuperTetrisDeluxe" window-dressing - underneath it's still
         the same old, plain old, in-one-plane Bridge Builder. The
         main differences are two new materials (including long-
         dreamt-of steel cable), and - acting as a massive
         disincentive to build stable creations - a flotilla of
         3D-illustrated splashes, creaks, and twangs when it all goes
         wrong. Oh and you can watch it go SPANG from the comfort of
         the train too. And you get more money in your budget.
         Talking of which: Twenty New World Order Dollars buys you
         the registered version: funkier bridges (with high-rise
         decks), a kilobrunel of bad-ass creeks to cross, keeps
         the designers from having to eat each other to survive, etc.

         POPS GOES LARGE (7pm, Fri, BBC1), though how they'll stretch
         it out to that duration is anyone's guess... wonder if there's
         a Northern-Ireland-style "Don't mention the war" edict on the
         new series of HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU (9pm, Fri, BBC1)... and
         C4 celebrates the wide range of dramatic TV roles available to
         women in TOP TEN TV: BITCHES (9pm, Sat, C4)... not much worth
         watching over the weekend: unnecessary Nic Cage wig-out "Wings
         Of Desire" remake CITY OF ANGELS (9pm, Sun, C5), or tiresome
         Tarantino ensemble yawn JACKIE BROWN (10pm, Sun, C4)... though
         Bucks Fizz's bitterness is superbly lampooned in ROCK PROFILE
         (11pm, Sun, BBC2)... presumably it's half-term or something,
         as weekday afternoons are packed with retro sci-fi - FORBIDDEN
         PLANET (1.35pm, Mon, C4) - plus kiddie fare like fat-kid nerd-
         revenger ANGUS (1.20pm, Wed, BBC2) and Disney adventure THE
         ISLAND AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD (1.10pm, Thu, BBC2)... last
         time they showed Famke Janssen Bond plodder GOLDENEYE (9pm,
         Mon, ITV), the Sunday Business newspaper ran the "Hackers
         Steal Military Satellite" plot as front-page news [NTK 1999-
         03-05]... and the largely self-explanatory HYPNOSEX (11.35pm,
         Mon, E4) plumbs new depths of pseudo-educational lifestyle
         programming... BBC2 just can't resist one last opportunity to
         mess around the scheduling of the SEINFELD finale (11.20pm,
         Tue &amp; Wed, BBC2)... trend-spotting docu COOLHUNTERS (9.50pm,
         Wed, BBC2) is helpfully produced by one "Nathan Hartshorn"...
         MUTANT X (9pm, Wed, Sky1) is indeed the wirework-heavy
         Toronto-filmed Marvel-approved low-rent "X Men" knockoff you
         suspected... Victoria Wood introduces classic comedy clips in
         SKETCH SHOW STORY (9pm, Thu, BBC1) - mildly preferable to her
         acting in them... a "Mike Magee" is among the high-stake
         gamblers on LATE NIGHT POKER (12.40am, Thu, C4), but we don't
         think it's the mystical former Register bon-vivant... and we

         strong legs and thighs. For real nudity check out Mark's
         previous collaboration with this film's director: Crying
         Freeman)... also filling out the pre-Halloween cast-of-
         unknowns horror quota comes competently uninspired monster

         otherwise Billy Crystal, Seth "Oz from Buffy" Green and the
         director of "Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise" fail
         to make up for Catherine Zeta-Jones and Julia Roberts's

         bestiality; speaking of sexual adulterous affairs as if they
         are required or natural; this movie even excuses masturbation)

         BONERS: CORRECTIONS, CLARIFICATIONS, AND "INCORRECTLY REGARDED
</span><span class="geekmedia">         AS GOOFS"&gt;&gt; hardly had we mailed out NTK 2001-09-21 than
         reader HARLEY MCGREW quickfired back: "The X11 antialias hack
         was done by Keith Packard. Not Derek". Yup, apologies, don't
         know how that one slipped through. "Also, it's X Window System
         or X or X11, not 'X-Windows'", Harley adds. "Although everyone
         calls it that, and no-one cares". This time, Harley, it is you
         who are mistaken: *we* care, and will now insist on calling it
         "X" as an act of penance and contrition to Keiths and Dereks
         everywhere... "I don't really have a joke for this", began
         ADRIAN MOULDER, encouragingly, "but that US corporate anthem
         [the magnificent <a href="http://www.americastandstall.net/">http://www.americastandstall.net/</a> from NTK

         everyone who thought we hadn't realised that, as ANDY WEST put

         murky estuary near Southampton" regarding NTK 2001-09-28's

         Andy - and spoil the ending for everybody, why don't you?...
         "Ah, someone else did see the TV graphics spelling out TWAT in
         big letters", sighed JOF [NTK 2001-10-12], who witnessed the
         aforementioned acrostic on the BBC's 6 O'Clock News, "although
         funnily enough nowhere on any BBC website"... and "Use fucking
         paragraphs you moron. This has gotta be the worst, most
         difficult to read writing style I've ever seen", suggested
         COLIN MCEVOY, possibly in response to NTK 2001-09-28's URL-
         packed BBC crap graphics round-up, or possibly as more general
         stylistic advice... of course, language like that serves only
         to preserve our uncompromising reputation with prudish mail
         clients like Eudora 5, as noted by "Another.com" enterpreneur
         STEVE BOWBRICK ("The last 'nice' email we got from you was
         dated 19 January": <a href="http://www.ntk.net/2001/10/19/eudora.jpg">http://www.ntk.net/2001/10/19/eudora.jpg</a> )
         and LUKE MCGUFF, who commended our frequent "three chillies"
         rating for trouncing his previous record holder "Letter from
         Susie Bright - December 2000" by "a whole third"... speaking
         of racy content, DAVID HEMMING alleged that "A quicksearch on
         amazon.co.uk for 'sabrina the teenage witch' in the video
         category returns "teenage sex orgy" as the third match", while
         failing to clarify what he was searching for in the first
         place; WILL WATTS drew our attention to a largely unexpected

         between (Vulcan?) nipples and "two stiff warp nacelles"; and,
         following detailed Tivo analysis of the new AOL TV ad, GUS
         "can confidently say that there are no nipples visible at any
         point and that in the zoom sequence in to the dress all the
         web pages shown are disturbingly wholesome". NTK regrets that
         these correspondences are all, for the love of God, closed...
