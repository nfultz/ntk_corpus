         to subliminal imagery: a bit of support now for THE REGISTER's
         knee-jerk scepticism over IOMART's steganographically
         encrypted files "which *might* be linked to Osama bin Laden"
         [our emphasis] on account of their "containing Arabic text and
         dates". Despite fears that the former Madasafish owner had
         found these by snooping on their customers, Iomart actually
         ditched its consumer ISP earlier this year and "now regards
         Net Intelligence as its main product" - "intelligence" partly
         provided by one STEPHEN WHITELAW who, perhaps prophetically,
         called steganography "the third biggest threat to US security
         after biological and chemical attack" almost exactly this time
         last year [NTK 2000-10-27]. Whitelaw's man-sized database of
         "the dark side of the web" was then claimed to be worth around
         $300m, though we suspect Iomart paid slightly less for it when
         they bought his company out of liquidation in July. Of course,
         those traditional stego bogeymen - porn files - remain a
         slightly odd choice for religious fundamentalists using public
         net access terminals; on the plus side, you don't have to
         worry about a blanket ban on all steganography, because all
         digital watermarking systems also fall into that category.

        - But why would *MI5* want more resources to monitor the net?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         You know, there was a time when we *dreamed* of having
         BBC1's WATCHDOG expose BT's secret policy of throttling ADSL
         bandwidth on specific high ports used by file-sharing
         clients. Hell, to have someone on the telly say any phrase
         in that sentence without drooling would have made our year.
         But now it's happened, we're a mite freaked. It doesn't make
         sense. Why did BT hide these ploys? If BT are concerned
         about bandwidth abuse, wouldn't it make sense to scare
         uneconomic customers away - or maybe kill them - as they
         have been doing to hardcore BT Anytime users? And if they
         went public, BT could make a strong argument for throttling:
         after all, it's not as if slow file-sharing is *that*
         problematic (your downloads take two evenings instead of
         one? horreur!). No, BT's sneakiness points to the flaw in
         their own plan: if their policy is widely known, it's
         trivially easy to circumvent. And unlike most of the
         entertaining arms races we're seeing in software these days,
         BT will always lose, because the smarter you try and make
         your network, the crappier it gets. BT: Bad network design;
         bad publicity; bad customer relations. Now things seem more
         comfortably familiar.

         CHATBOT OF THE YEAR comes to London's Science Museum at some
         point tomorrow (Sat 2001-10-13), though if you prefer your
         off-the-wall-hypothesising to have some sort of point, there's
         also the ECOLOGICAL DESIGN ASSOCIATION's "10UP" event which
         includes "defining a vision for the next ten years" among its
         varied goals (from 9am, Sat 2001-10-13, UKP40, Conway Hall,
         London WC1). Sure, they're designers, so the results may not
         always be too practical - but you've got to admit, the guy who
         wants to know if "polymer acoustic guitars have any 'ecodesign
         advantages' over traditional wooden instruments" is definitely
         one to watch in the future.

         even by demo standards: but when you're cross posting to
         comp.sys.sinclair and comp.sys.cbm, you've got to be tough.
         Entries had to be a playable game; total code size had to be
         under 512 bytes or 2KB, excluding BASIC bootloader; and the
         game should run on the Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad
         CPC, or Atari 8 bit computers. Yeah, middle-class BBC Micro
         Fauntleroy's need not apply. The closing date was 2001-09-30
         (how retro is that?) but, ahh, now comes the judging. A 52KB
         zip gets you 22 C64 games, 6 Speccie specks, two CPC
         proglets, and one Atari shoo-in, "Asteraxis 2K". A great
         responsibility - and a good few hours messing with emulators
         - now befalls you. If you can fight through the
         understandable preponderance of Snake 'n' Tetris games in
         here, we're sure you'll find something to make you cry with
         the pain of lost innocence and fucked-up tape copies.

         C-3PO gay?" episode of WILL AND GRACE (9.30pm, Fri, C4)...
         contemporary photorealist David Hockney's SECRET KNOWLEDGE
         (6.50pm, Sat, BBC2) argues painters of the past aren't as good
         as he is, and "cheated using mirrors"... while C4 seem to be
         launching some sort of unofficial sci-fi weekend with Starlab/
         Rodney Brooks/ some-guy-in-a-shed robotics face-off BATTLE OF
         THE ROBOTS: THE HUNT FOR AI (8pm, Sat, C4)... NTK's Ben Moor
         neglects to point out that "Sapphire" and "Steel" aren't
         technically "elements" in TOP TEN TV: SCI-FI (9pm, Sat, C4)...
         Mark Kermode, perhaps predictably, gets all excited over the
         uncompromising vision and graphic violence of the Alien films
         in ALIEN EVOLUTION (10.40pm, Sat, C4), inexplicably followed
         by bemused Philip K Dick adaptation SCREAMERS (12midnight,
         Sat, C4)... and maybe it's just us, but this ALIEN CONTACT
         docu (1.40pm, Sun, C4) sounds a lot like the old-Amiga-demo-
         featuring "What If: ET?" mockumentary shown on C5 a few weeks
         ago... black-and-white alleged "Alien" inspiration IT! THE
         TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE (2.45pm, Sun, C4) memorably features
         pre-Apollo astronauts hunting an on-board xenomorph with a
         bazooka... tough call for Sigourney Weaver fans as ALIEN:
         RESURRECTION (10pm, Sun, C4) goes up against '70s domestic
         drama THE ICE STORM (9pm, Sun, BBC2), which also has Katie
         Holmes in it... and Steps and Shirley Bassey are viciously
         lampooned in this week's ROCK PROFILE (11pm, Sun, BBC2)... "a
         lot of vomiting" is promised in extreme "1940s House" followup
         PLAGUE, FIRE, WAR AND TREASON (9pm, Mon, C4)... C5's unique
         interpretation of "factual output" continues with a cheesy
         reconstruction of THE TUTANKHAMUN CONSPIRACY (8pm, Tue, C5),
         handily followed by their annual showing of groovy Mel Gibson/
         Patrick Stewart MK-Ultra thriller CONSPIRACY THEORY (9pm, Tue,
         C5)... similarly, dieting docu SKINNY WOMEN (9pm, Wed, C4) is
         educationally double-billed with ALLY MCBEAL (10pm, Wed, C4),
         then followed by another David E Kelley creation THE PRACTICE
         (11.35pm, Wed, BBC1), although Lara Flynn Boyle isn't in these
         "previously shown on Sky and ITV" early 1997 episodes...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; pretty much the same feelgood teen filth as the first
         one, though this time there's a bit more of Alyson "Willow"
         Hannigan and you get to see the full "The Terminator" chat-up
         routine in AMERICAN PIE 2 (<a href="http://www.cndb.com/">http://www.cndb.com/</a> : [Lisa
         Arturo] has small tit[s] with nice brown nipples; [Denise
         Faye] had bigger breasts with brown areolas but pink nipples;
         in the middle of the movie you get a full view of [Jason
         Biggs'] butt again after he glues his hand to his penis)...
         inexplicably, the craze for gross-out comedies seems to have
         passed Sean Penn and Jack Nicholson by, as they stick with
         glacial '70s-style smalltown child-murder character-study THE
         PLEDGE (<a href="http://www.screenit.com/movies/2001/the_pledge.html">http://www.screenit.com/movies/2001/the_pledge.html</a> :
         We briefly see most of the underside of a woman's thigh)... or
         there's London-centric Nathan Barley "Human Traffic" remake
         SOUTH WEST 9 (<a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/">http://www.bbfc.co.uk/</a> : rated 18 for "drugs
         use, very strong language, sex and some violence") - so
         obscure it doesn't seem to even be in the imdb... while the
         "Flick/Fuck" confusion once again besets the Movie Chart
         Show's poster quote "A Fruity Flick Ripe For The Picking" for
         Oirish sex comedy PEACHES (<a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/">http://www.bbfc.co.uk/</a> : rated 15
         for "frequent strong language") - not, it appears, based on
         the Presidents Of The USA song of the same name...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CONFECTIONERY THEORY&gt;&gt; a "biscuits and cereals" special this
         month, to commemorate both the coming of autumn and next
         week's WORLD ANTI-McDONALD'S DAY <a href="http://www.mcspotlight.org/">http://www.mcspotlight.org/</a> .
         Also their new MCCHICKEN TIKKA WRAP (UKP1.99) and MEGA MAC
         MEAL (UKP3.99) are a bit of a disappointment to be honest, and
         we didn't feel we could really compete with the comprehensive
         likes of <a href="http://www.horklezorp.com/entertainment/mcsauce/">http://www.horklezorp.com/entertainment/mcsauce/</a> ...
         anyway, following the example of Warren Ellis' "Stormwatch",
         KELLOGG's have subdivided their awesome CRUNCHY NUT brand into
         CRUNCHY NUT RED (from UKP1.89), setting aside the ingredients
         with greatest destructive capability - cranberry fruit pieces,
         yoghurt flavour flakes, and what can only be described as
         "slivers" of almond - for acts of deterrent display and
         retaliation. CRUNCHY NUT PRIME will now be assigned to address
         "supercereal threats in hotwar situations" - for instance,
         READY BREK's RIP, MIX AND MICRO (from UKP1.49, 6 sachets),
         which frankly don't seem to taste of anything much, let alone
         "Chocca Chocolate", "Saucy Strawberry" or "Bursting Banana".
         And the jury's still out on NESTLE'S "Lightly Sweetened Whole
         Wheat Cereal" SPORTIES, with their sinister "REVOLUTIONARY new
         Power Zone"... that "delicious yoghurt flavour topping" pops
         up again on the mildly uninteresting KELLOGG'S SPECIAL K BAR,
         but pseudo-health product of the month remains CADBURY'S
         chocolate-coated BRUNCH BAR, available in both hazelnut and
         raisin variants, and rivalling even CADBURY'S CARAMEL FINGERS
         (99p/125g) and limited edition TOFFEE APPLE MARYLAND COOKIES.
         Reader ALAN CONNOR reports TUNNOCK'S DARK CHOCOLATE CARAMEL
         WAFER - the firm's "first new product in living memory" - "has
         a Rich Tea sophistication which almost makes up for in class
         what it lacks in the pure Scottish sugar-and-fat hit of the
         original". And Cyrillic ingredients appear on the tasty new
         "Double Choc" and "Tangy Orange" flavours of BURTON'S SPECIAL
         EDITION WAGON WHEELS because Russia apparently constitutes a
         major export market for these decadent Wild Western delicacies
         ... you'll probably want to wash all that down with a glass or
         two of LUVLY LATTE FRIJJ, TOP TOFFEE GULP (59p), Nestle's "Hot
         When You Want" self-heating cans of NESCAFE ORIGINAL (now back
         on trial in Birmingham), or even INTERCONTINENTAL BRANDS' ANT
         NATURAL STIMULATION soft drink (99p/275ml), a fruit juice
         featuring the great taste of red and black Asian Mountain ants
         - available from pubs and pet shops, presumably...
