         balls in an Arkanoid clone. Lo, and TEMPO did announce
         "free" free Internet access, with BT instantly ricocheting
         back with some dumb "free calls with an ad every 2 minutes"
         service that no-one will adopt. And the EU's anonymity
         proposals began to look increasingly low on lives, with
         smart folk in the Netherlands and UK publically supporting
         ZERO KNOWLEDGE's Freedom network, which promises an
         international anonymous network, with -cough- distributed
         liability. Or in other words, Europe's too small a place to
         stop this kind of thing.

</span><span class="item">         Let's get this straight. ARM bought out ACORN, its own
         parent company, which is a bit sick. Only it didn't, because
         even though Acorn was paid for in ARM shares, the shares
         belonged to MORGAN STANLEY: so it was this bank who now own
         Acorn. Except that everyone's saying that was just a tax
         dodge, and ARM will end up buying up the Acorn shares off
         Morgan Stanley in the end (which is still a bit sick).
         Except that the only bit of Acorn that has any emotional
         appeal, the bit that used to make RISC PCs, wasn't sold to
         Morgan Stanley - it was sold to PACE TECHNOLOGIES for 200K.
         So it's not so bad, because Pace is an oldskool company too.
         Except that, actually, the only people interested in
         supporting RISC OS now aren't Acorn at all, but RISC OS
         LIMITED, who bought the license for RISC OS before all this
         happened. Except that Acorn used to own 20% of RISC OS Ltd.
         So who owns that? And why in God's name can't these companies 
         go Falco in a dignified fashion?

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; FRASIER (10pm, Fri, C4) is always funniest when it's
         about food... David STRASSMAN (10.30pm, Fri, ITV) pioneers the
         field of animatronic swearing... and ITV cunningly combines
         two of TV's most popular genres as one upcoming youngster
         turns out to be DESPERATELY SEEKING STARDOM - in the porn biz!
         (10pm, Fri, ITV)... "We can put a man on the moon, but we
         can't bomb a minor Eastern European country back to the stone
         age" ponders Tom Hanks's reverential 12-part NASA docu-drama
         FROM THE EARTH TO THE MOON (12noon, Sat, C4)... everyone raves
         about doddery Eastwood Western UNFORGIVEN (10pm, Sat, ITV) -
         but it's no "The Quick And The Dead"... and the rest of Bank
         Holiday weekend is dominated by a foul-mouthed feast for SOUTH
         PARK fans, with a 2-hour special on cable/ satellite (from
         9pm, Sat, SkyOne) including an hour-long "South Park
         Discovered"... C4 picks up the squishy baton on Mon with 5
         hours of OH MY GOD, IT'S SOUTH PARK (from 9pm, Mon, C4),
         featuring season 2 opener "Not Without My Anus" and Parker/
         Stone's "Cannibal! The Musical". Then, as if to prepare you
         for the upcoming "Mechastreisand" episode, behold: GODZILLA VS
         MECHAGODZILLA (2am, Mon, C4)... both FRENCH AND SAUNDERS
         (9.55pm, Sun, BBC1) and RORY BREMNER (9pm, Sun, C4) continue
         to confuse dressing up as famous people with actual comedy...
         Jon Ronson interviews subterranean enthusiasts on FOR THE LOVE
         OF (2.50am, Sun, C4)... and it's a real grab-bag of sci-fi
         elements behind ROBIN COOK'S INVASION (9pm, Sun &amp; Mon, C5) -
         like The Last Train; a meteor impact or suspended animation
         just doesn't cut it any more, you've got to have *both*...
         disappointingly, food show BIG KEVIN LITTLE KEVIN (8pm, Tue,
         BBC2) is not a rapid weight-loss sequel to the "Fountain Of
         Youth" kids' classic... sympathetic Spice-umentary GERI (9pm,
         Wed, C4) nevertheless records some of the "criticism and
         ridicule" levelled at the talentless ginger trollop... while
         hard-hitting heavily promoted mental asylum drama PSYCHOS
         (10pm, Thu, C4) comes of course from the writer who translated
         "Mad About You" into "Loved By You" for the British screen...
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; "geek heaven" is NTK reader Reverend Joe McNally's
         praise for Cronenberg's icky new Videodrome-II VR-parable set
         in biotech parallel universe EXISTENZ (imdb: computers /
         futuristic / virtual-reality), largely for its spot-on
         spoofing of in-game NPCs with dodgy accents and bad AI - were
         Mark Hamill and Tim Curry somehow not available? Oddly, the UK
         launch is being sponsored by fellow Dreamcasters Sega,
         implying (Rev McNally again): "(a) they have a much more
         highly-developed sense of humour than one might normally
         associate with games companies, or (b) they haven't actually
         seen it"... rather less effective art-horror surfaces from
         Annette Bening's fruity underwater nightmare IN DREAMS (imdb:
         psychological) - remember: "down to earth" Neil Jordan (Mona
         Lisa, The Crying Game, The Butcher Boy) good; "supernatural"
         Neil Jordan (A Company Of Wolves, Interview With A Vampire)
         *bad*!... and while the plot of Adam Sandler's latest retard-
         makes-good irritation THE WATERBOY (imdb: football / sport)
         sounds like it *might* be lifted from an Oliver Sacks case,
         that honour actually goes to vision-returning neurology-
         romancer AT FIRST SIGHT (imdb: blindness) - not a fantastic
         job by Val "The Saint" Kilmer, Irwin "The Net" Winkler, though
         it has provoked the most OTT Christian review seen so far:
     <a href="http://www.startext.net/homes/chldcare/capreports/at1stsight99.htm">http://www.startext.net/homes/chldcare/capreports/at1stsight99.htm</a>
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         DEAD TREES&gt;&gt; you can already hear the ASA sharpening their
         blue pencils over the lame "Get some coke for Jamie's party"
         campaign for elderly-lads' mag LATER (launch price UKP1.50).
         We've no doubt that there *is* a good article to be written
         about future-sport violence-movie Rollerball, though Later has
         run something else entirely... FHM (UKP2.80) leads, once
         again, with "GAIL PORTER: She's Stunning, She's Nude" - And
         Missing Her Right Nipple, from the looks of things... oh well,
         it was an abridged version of David Scheff's excellent "Game
         Over" book on the front of ARCADE (UKP2.80). Still, good to
         see their dreadful pic of 4 drongos playing video games over
         beer 'n' pizza has been swiftly replaced by 3 even worse
         caricatures (p130), the girl of which is so captivated by
         their subs offer that she's neglected to put a cartridge in
         her Game Boy... "Is PIRACY killing the Amiga?" bravely ponders
         AMIGA FORMAT (UKP5.95) - well, either that or someone's
         stopped manufacturing the hardware... editorial of current
         INTERNET magazine is "such rubbish" it "must be a troll",
         readers report - is that why subs cut the last line?... "like
         a slimmer, cheaper version of Wired but with Douglas Rushkoff
         writing for it" isn't a great recommendation for SHIFT
         (Borders, UKP3) <a href="http://www.shift.com/">http://www.shift.com/</a> - plus, being Canadian,
         it's depressingly obsessed with both US *and* UK style
         culture... but STEVE CIARCIA'S CIRCUIT CELLAR INK (Borders,
         UKP3), the "Mork And Mindy" to Byte's "Happy Days", drags
         itself over here at last, whispering that the BYTE home
         automation system isn't Y2K compliant... finally, a swift
         round-up of the new "Internet for Idiots" mags: the debut
         issue of INTERNET MONTHLY ("The *real people's* guide to the
         Internet"; UKP1.99) takes a firm stand against the
         "jargonauts", goes on to reveal that those real (patient)
         people are logging on with "28bps, 36bps or 56bps modems"
         (p139), then concludes with - you've guessed it - a guide to
         smilies (p149)... "Don't take too much advice from anyone who
         has been online earlier than 1996" chortles Future's INTERNET
         ADVISOR (p85; UKP1.99) - yeah, what would they know, eh?...
         yet the ultimate irony goes to Paragon's erratically
         distributed WEB PAGES MADE EASY (UKP3.95) - we'd have more
         confidence in their clunky FrontPage / PageMill / HotMetal
         tutorials if it didn't look like they'd borrowed their entire
         (dreadful) design from .Net Magazine...
