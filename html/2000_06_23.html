</span><span class="item">         Well, it looks like Marc Andreessen couldn't make it to give
         his backing to DOT NET, Microsoft's new direction, as
         originally planned. Apparently he was caught trying to climb
         out the toilet window just before the demo, and had to be
         beaten to death. Still, Gates and Ballmer did okay on their
         own, explaining how their renamed NGWS, as well as being an
         engine of an instant lawsuit with Future Publishing, was the
         embodiment of Gate's new Net-as-OS plans. Terrifyingly, it
         also seems to show that Redmond really does believe its own
         publicity. Not only are they attempting to introduce a whole
         raft of new pseudo-standards (note to editors: supporting
         XML as a transport is as much following industry standards
         as supporting eight bit binary), but they're also planning
         to redo the desktop, re-route around the browser, and - once
         again, introduce another definitely-not-a-Java-killer, a
         proprietary language called C#. The ambition, as ever, is
         breathtaking: if this all works as planned, Gates 
         indicated, MS will be in a monopoly position at almost every
         level of Net business. And wouldn't that be cool, he
         grinned - as though everyone, including the Supreme Court
         would grin back. Meanwhile, in Australia, we have MS
         claiming that the new National Privacy Principles "may
         unnecessarily restrict our ability to investigate and
         enforce our intellectual property rights". Ah, hell,
         let's give them their own courts and a police force
         and have done with it.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A defender for RIP! John Carr has been quick to come to the
         defence of the new bill, telling the OBSERVER newspaper that
         "Children, consumers, trading companies and financial
         institutions have all been targeted and harmed, some very
         seriously" by the evil cyberterrorists that the bill will
         thwart. He does this, of course, in his role as
         outspokensman for NCH Action for Children - and certainly
         not as the husband of Baroness Thornton, the peer most keen
         in the house get the industry to pay for RIP. The government
         may want to cast an eye over Carr's other suggestions,
         however. An enthusiastic advocate of censorware (and
         advocate of a 5p tax on every Net user to fund his
         obligatory Web ratings system), he was less than happy when
         Burger King gave out free copies of the Net Nanny filtering
         prog this month. It turned out that those innocent children
         were grabbing the free CDs to get hold of the list of banned
         pr0n sites that Nanny displays during the install. "A
         complete mess", he sighed. Which is what happens when
         you act without thinking these things through, John.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         So the new look, new stupid, Deja decided to killfile five
         years of Usenet archiving to concentrate on its
         comparison-shopping core incompentency ("only 10% of our
         traffic is to postings older than a year", says the company,
         neatly decimating their user base in one swoop). But surely
         Usenet is the best shopping guide there is? Take the healthy
         exchange of opinions across the alt.digitiser newsfroup this
         week on WACKY RACES, the new Mario-kartalike from Gremlin
         software. Some say it appears to be "fun" and "looks great".
         Others disagree ("pile of poo","shit"). But who do you
         trust? At first glance, the fact that all the positive
         reviews come from disposable dejanews accounts looks a
         little suspect. But then, as MARK WILLIAMSON spotted, a
         quick perusal of the headers show they *are* experts:
         they all originate from Gremlin's own network. And if anyone
         knew it was shit and needed a bit of fake grassroots
         propping-up, it'd be Gremlin's PR team, right?

</span><span class="item">         As pre-advertised last week, the UK crypto community get
         together to tell the *real* story of cracking Enigma (among
         other things) in Cambridge all day Sat 2000-06-24 (Whit
         Diffie's co-"organised" it, but will he be there in person?).
         Continuing the retro theme, 8-bit get-together BRITMEET 3 will
         be clashing the attributes from Saturday morning onwards -
         and, further to our observation that these events always seem
         to take place in a village hall somewhere in Hertfordshire,
         that's exactly where they're holding it.

         NICKS "computer arts" conference (for a start, it's meant 3
         weeks of easy material). Latest is that Alexei Shulgin's
         hilarious underclocked cyber-rock 386DX had to be cancelled
         due to a "misclassification" - but fear not, music fans,
         because, in an event that's almost *too* self-consciously
         TVGoHome in its billing, none other than HARI KUNZRU will be
         spinning "cutting edge electronic tracks in a lounge-y
         environment while videos of nuclear weapons tests are
         projected onto the gallery windows in film gathered by the
         Land Use Interpretation Centre". This from 8pm Sat 2000-06-24,
         Hoxton Sq, London, while RTMark tout their same old anti-
         corporate "victories" from 2pm Sun, same venue.

         celebrity, but Jason Jones, the coder behind such Mac 3D
         smashes as MARATHON, MYTH, and the expectantly-awaited HALO
         has his own clan o'fans. Enthusiastic Mac advocates, mainly,
         who still appreciate how his company, Bungie, stuck with the
         platform through thick and thin. In their eyes, the
         MacCarmack can truly can do no wrong. Unless they, say, sold
         the whole company to Microsoft for an undisclosed sum, and
         bunked out of Chicago to darkest Redmond to work on the
         X-Box. Like Bungie did last week. Oops. Anyway, before the
         entire community exploded into pro and anti MicroBung
         factions, the gift that keeps on giving was given unto them:
         a GPLed source archive of Marathon II. Now, as their master,
         his eyes blinded by the Seattle mind-control lasers, screams
         "AZAG-THOTH TA ARDATA! IA MARDUK! IA MARDUK!" in the frozen
         wastes, an elite band of Mac free softwarers keep the flame
         alive. Mainly by writing a mini-app for the MacOS that lets
         you shut down applications by shooting at them with a .44
         Magnum. But that's open source for you. It's called Aleph 1
         Resource Manager.

         more), while Paul Auster holds onto the number 2 slot with NEW
         YORK TRILOGY, and The Onion, Dave Barry, Carl Hiaasen, KW

         Paulos' ONCE UPON A NUMBER: THE HIDDEN MATHEMATICAL LOGIC OF
         STORIES (featuring an all-too convincing computational
         analysis of humour), and Steven "Guardian" Poole's pretentious
         Edge-fodder TRIGGER HAPPY: THE INNER LIFE OF VIDEOGAMES - a
         mildly more insightful version of JC Herz's "Joystick Nation"
         (and not in a good way)... not much in the way of reader
         reviews so far: IAN HOLMES wanted people to know that Rudy
         Rucker's REALWARE is "out soon" (or now, in fact, in the US -
         maybe he mailed us a while ago); the ubiquitous ALAN CONNOR   
         noted that our chart mentions books he's ordered but that   
         Amazon "have no intention of sending me because they can't
         find them or they don't exist"; and, finally, several people
         sent us an elaborate pseudo-pyramid scam exploiting Amazon's
         current UKP5 press-ad voucher scheme... basically, you use the
         voucher to buy Wilbur Smith's MONSOON (UKP1.99, current sales
         rank: 42) - or anything else which, plus p&amp;p, comes to less
         than UKP5 - then persuade 20 of your friends to do the same

         worth reading. Loathsome chain-letter? Revenge on Amazon? Or
         just some mad Wilbur Smith viral marketing? You decide...
