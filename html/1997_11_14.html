</span><span class="item">         It's rare that hexadecimal turns out to be so viciously
         onomatopoeic. The "F00F" bug, revealed on newsgroups last
         Friday, is just four bytes which, executed by a Pentium,
         freeze the chip and snap the spine of even the most heavily
         defended Intel-based operating system (oh yes, Linux too).
         Most of the technical press nobly chose not to reveal the
         final two bytes, confident in the knowledge that h/\c&lt;er
         d00dz would never spend ten seconds at DejaNews discovering
         that it's "C7C8". Meanwhile, INTEL's bunny-suited
         spokespeople fed clueless hacks bizarre reassurances that
         it was not a problem - and even if it was, it wasn't
         Intel's. The NY Times reported that "the problem appears to
         be a virus affecting processor performance, rather than a
         flaw in the chip" (phew - it's only a *self-replicating*
         defect), while one Intel rep executed the evergreen "Push
         Problem To Source" command, claiming "that the flaw was
         found by an Intel competitor looking for undocumented
         instructions on the chip". Gad, how low can people sink?
         (The F00F bug, needless to say, does not occur in any
         competing Pentium clones.)

         said to mutter after Steve Jobs's world-shaking press
         conference on Monday. And it was. The big three announcements,
         relayed live to Apple offices around the world were: brand new
         super 233Mhz+ PowerPC machines (great!), super new direct-
         selling Apple Web Store (note: American orders only), and
         incredible new customised manufacturing scheme (not available
         outside the US). We're assuming this is Apple's ongoing
         punishment of "the countries for the rest of us" for sending
         them Jean-Louis Gassee.

         technical-mag style. Here goes. "Item! EASYNET received
         15,000 copies of their latest client software from the
         pressing plant this week, all ready for the Christmas rush.
         Imagine their seasonal delight when the packaged CDs were
         found to contain, not a full ISP connection kit, but copies
         of David Essex's Christmas Hits. Elsewhere, rumours
         knocking around top nobs in the new media community suggest
         that a sizeable chunk of MSN UK's staff are in for a *very*

         (networking software, Windows CE palmtops and the latest
         mousemats) the Las Vegas exhibition looks to have beaten
         even its own sanity-shattering records. Check out the line-

         David Byrne's Oasis tribute band doing novelty Radiohead
         cover versions - in a good way, of course. True to his
         geekazoid roots, McCandless has recorded the whole thing,
         Jyoti-Mishra-style, on his bedroom PC for about 130 quid -
         though, disappointingly, the catchy title track, "Smoother

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV &gt;&gt; Nice Painter, Suits You, Check-out Girl - the only
         thing they don't have is a sketch with two guys constantly
         repeating their favourite catchphrases from the FAST SHOW
         (9.30pm, Fri, BBC2) - though, on second thoughts, that
         could apply to all of them... as if a triple bill of the
         repetitive MAN FROM UNCLE (BBC2, Sat) wasn't insane enough,
         the first starts at 7am, the last at 2.35... Christmas
         comes early with SCROOGED (9pm, Sat, BBC1), a surprisingly
         good Bill Murray/ Lee Majors comedy (and there's something
         you can't say every day)... even compared to "new" You've
         Been Framed, AS SEEN ON TV (11.20am, Sun, BBC2) is still
         the best camcorder show of all time... weirdly, it isn't
         just a repeat (or even a re-CGI'd "Special Edition"), but a
         total remake of BBC perennial THE PHOENIX AND THE CARPET
         (5pm, Sun, BBC2) - though unlikely to match the bawdy
         frolics of period drama TOM JONES (9pm, Sun, BBC1), with
         Brian Blessed in full "Gordon's *alive*?" form... here's
         hoping the (more entertaining) "M" variant gets equal time
         when THE SOUTH BANK SHOW (10.50pm, Sun, ITV) profiles Iain
         Banks... sparks will fly as MOVERS AND SHAKERS (8pm, Mon,
         C4) looks at Scalextric fans, while EQUINOX (9pm, Mon, C4)
         discovers another exciting interviewee (a 96-year-old
         survivor of the Tunguska explosion), in an edition
         prosaically entitled "The Day The Earth Got Hit"... surely
         Jennifer "Rachel from Friends" Aniston can maintain the
         level of swearing one has come to expect from THE LARRY
         SANDERS SHOW (11.40pm, Tue, BBC2)?... forget scientologist
         L Ron Hubbard's SECRET LIVES (Wed, 9pm, C4) - how did he
         manage to publish several huge sci-fi novels several years
         after his "death"?... Eric Bogosian plays an out-of-control
         shock-jock in TALK RADIO (9pm, Thu, C5), arguably Oliver
         Stone's most watchable movie (and you don't hear that too
         often either)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES &gt;&gt; GI JANE (imdb: action / drama / navy / commando /
         training / feminism / prejudice) is by far the most
         viciously sadistic film of the year, maybe even enough to
         make you forgive Demi Moore for The Scarlet Letter and
         Striptease?... everyone seems to love Kevin Smith's
         fanboy/lesbian romance CHASING AMY (imdb: romance /
         jealousy / friendship / love / comics / lesbian / gay /
         comedy / hockey / sexuality / foul-language / vulgarity /
         lesbian-scene / drama) - though it's not as unpleasantly
         funny as his magnum opus, Clerks... from 1992, the re-
         released FULL CONTACT (imdb: action) is probably for the
         more dedicated fans of Ringo Lam, Chow Yun-Fat, Hong Kong
         chop-socky (or Quentin Tarantino)... making this week's
         out-of-nowhere surprise recommendation the lamer-vs-Kramer
         courtroom farce TRIAL AND ERROR (imdb: comedy) - with
         Michael Richards (from Seinfeld), Rip Torn (from Larry
         Sanders), and, er, the same director as the Sgt Bilko movie
         and Nuns On The Run...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MEAL REPLACEMENT PRODUCTS &gt;&gt; NTK's "f00d d00d" Ben Moor
         reports that WRIGLEY'S new menthol/eucalyptus chewing gum,
         AIRWAVES, has a total nutritional content of "almost zero"
         (across all categories), and bears the small-print warning
         "Excessive consumption may produce laxative effects". All
         in all, a big thumbs-up then, apart from the product's
         taste - "like sucking radio"... we don't know what scared
         us more: a) BURGEN bread with "added plant oestrogens", b)
         KELLOGG'S appropriating your mum's rice-krispie cakes into
         the tasty (but geometrically misguided) SQUARES - or c) the
         apparent replacement of DAIRYLEA DIP &amp; PIZZA CRACKERS by
         the shockingly bland DAIRYLEA DIP &amp; BREADSTICKS. Come on,
         Kraft! they're competing for the same ecological snack-
         niche!... can't seem to find the new Nestle MAVERICK bar
         anywhere, but CADBURY persist with woeful attempts at a
         citrus/chocolate crossover with the "limited edition" TIME
         OUT ORANGE (you can see why - it's disgusting). In fact,
         their plain Dairy-Milk-style ORANGE bar ("Orange Flavoured
         Milk Chocolate") isn't too bad, but still has about as much
         chance against Terry's original choc-orange-spin-off as
         Nestle's HERCULES MAGIC BALL has against the GLOWING
         GHOSTIES KINDER EGGS...

         mind if the prize goes to Dr Nik Cain, one of the few
         contestants who didn't pepper his entry with jeers and cat-
         calls at our generous nature. The good Dr receives a copy
         of THE LEVELLERS album (yes, be impressed), a NINTENDO
         GOLDENEYE poster, and Star Trek: Starfleet Academy (which,
         should Interplay be reading this, is NOT a competition
         prize - Nik is officially reviewing it for NTK, and anyway
         I've already opened the box and installed it on my machine,
         and it's great, so what's the problem, huh?). Plus,
         naturellement, the free invite to the .NOT Awards. Which
         we're really are going to announce next week. Ahem. Here's

         this newsletter, and one time he put in a forthcoming diary
         event that actually happened exactly a year previously, and
         they didn't sack *him*, so why should you have to go? [See
