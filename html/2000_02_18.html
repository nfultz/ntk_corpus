</span><span class="item">         RSA hacked? My God: are not even the highest citadels safe
         from the heterogenous swarm of DoS script kiddies? Well, not
         quite: it turned out to be just the usual "lone hacker"
         using DNS poisoning to redirect the requests. Although the
         traceroutes leading to Columbia were a nice touch - and
         doesn't poisoning sound exotic? Certainly a bit more
         dangerous than January's VIRGIN NET e-mail password breach.
         Despite hushed comments in the papers about the coteries of
         sophisticated cyberterrorists holding the company to ransom,
         the truth turned out to be a little simpler. Virgin's
         managed to lose the machine with the data on. One minute, it
         was sitting there happily in their ultra-secure operations
         center. The next: gone. Or at least, nobody could find it,
         so they gave up, and passed the onus onto their customers.
         The lessons? Always change your passwords: and do try to
         remember where you parked that drive.

         goons brings out a neater version, and the auslanders begin
         to concede your point (KDE, WinAmp, trainers). Third, about
         two months later, when the mundanes excitedly inform you of
         the "brand new thing" you would definitely like, if only you
         could spare an hour listening to them explain it badly
         (theories of "Grey" alien invasion, 3D avatar chatrooms).
         The X10 home automation craze has defiantly entered stage
         two with MISTERHOME, an integrated management system for
         Linux and those light-switches-with-a-serial-port that Steve
         Ciarcia went mad trying to popularise. Nothing that you
         haven't already imagined in your wet Asimov fantasies
         (semi-automated TV listing/ VCR programming, GPS tracking of
         your stolen car, Web-based administration and burglary
         invitations), but it's nice to see it all in one place.
         That place being your flat.

         transplants, with the second showing of Hywel "Shelley" 
         Bennett's PERCY (12.25am, Fri, BBC1) in just 15 months... ITV 
         hits back with acclaimed sci-fi containment drama LIFEPOD 
         (12midnight-ish, Sat, most ITV regions)... and presumably any 
         future series of THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN (10pm, Fri, BBC2; 
         repeated 9.30pm on Sun with "making of" docu) will abandon 
         jokes altogether to concentrate on suburban gothic horror - 
         but there's always the "revised repeats" of FOCUS NORTH 
         (12.35am, Thu, C4)... no Buffy repeat but "It's Scary Out 
         There" compensates with John Carpenter Cthulhu clunker IN THE 
         MOUTH OF MADNESS (10.50pm, Sat, BBC2) and George Romero's 
         shopping mall consumer satire DAWN OF THE DEAD (12.20am, Sat, 
         BBC2)... new kids show HYPERLINKS (9.20am, Sun, BBC2) is 
         bugger all to do with the net; another series of shouty 
         runaround SUB ZERO (11am, Sun, BBC2) is bugger all to do with 
         video games and/or an entertaining viewing experience... while 
         Jude Law/ Sadie Frost ramraiding romp SHOPPING (10pm, Mon, C4) 
         resembles a low-rent Michael Bay directing an episode of "The 
         Bill" - but in a good way!... the docu-soap barrel bottom 
         scrapes along with THE SECRET WORLD OF YEAR 3 (9.50pm, Tue, 
         BBC2) featuring the everyday lives of a class of 7 year-
         olds... Sherilyn "Twin Peaks" Fenn pops out of the "Where are 
         they now?" file for trashy MIB chiller THE SHADOW MEN (9pm, 
         Wed, C5)... and C4 combines two ratings-winning formats - 
         cock-up compilations and WW2 documentaries - into the 
         undeniably appealing GREAT MILITARY BLUNDERS (8pm, Thu, C4)... 
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; stand by for Moloko's remixes of "The Mikado" shooting

         Leigh's touchingly overlong Gilbert O'Sullivan tribute TOPSY 
         TURVY (MPAA: rated R for a scene of risque nudity), though, 
         disappointingly for fans of Leigh's previous work, he hasn't 
         set the story on a mock-working-class housing estate... Chris 
         "Who?" O'Donnell has 24 hours to marry Renee "Jerry Maguire" 
         Zellweger to inherit $10m in exactly-as-you'd-expect romantic 
         fluff THE BACHELOR (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a> : 
         several references to male and female anatomy with clear 
         intent; dialogue and imagery to further the general decay of 
         inhibition and standards of acceptance; a lot of excessive 
         breast and upper leg exposure that is not commonplace in the 
         "real world" except in entertainment; though, oddly, no 
         objection to the whole concept of marrying for cash)... and

         TOP BONER BONANZA - A COMPILATION OF (LARGELY) GENITALIA-
</span><span class="geekmedia">         RELATED RECENT ERRORS THAT EVEN PAUL BLEZ DIDN'T SPOT&gt;&gt; eagle-
         eyed LUCIE MELAHN was the *only* reader (not NTK's only female
         reader, we're sure) to query NTK 2000-02-04's description of
         Hepburn as "XY-rockers", adding "of course, you're aware that
         girl bands really have XX chromosomes". Er yeah, unless we
         were trying to imply that they're secretly men (we weren't)...
         "What on earth are those parentheses supposed to achieve?",    
         inquired JOHN HARTNUP of NTK 2000-01-28's "(.*)sex(.*)"        
         regexp, "The only purpose I could imagine would be if you    
         wanted to extract what came before and after the sex (wine and         
         a cigarette?)" "Actually I just stuck them in so because
         .*sex.* looked wrong," responds NTK's irredeemably laddish             
         Essex correspondent, "and I got to do a breasts joke"...
         and don't write in that saying breasts aren't funny (nor,    
         technically, genitals - we'll come to that), as proved by
         MARTIN BACON's correction of NTK 2000-01-28's Celebrity Nudity         
         Database quote, "a huge aureole that seems to cover a third of
         her ample bosoms". "Aureoles," says Martin, "usually surround   
         heads, at least in illuminated manuscripts and stained glass       
         windows. Perhaps the author meant areola, the skin around the
         nipple. Or perhaps the film industry has different views on
         where holiness resides nowadays"... in less sexually-related
         corrigenda, Bob Crispen proposed "Let me be the 10,000th 
         caller (and probably the first from Alabama) to point out that
         it's 'cui bono' not 'qui bono': 'to whom the good', not 'who           
         is good'" [NTK 2000-02-11]... "AFAIK the Hebrew system *adds*          
         the letters in a name to get a numeric value, so if w = 6,    
         then www = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18... and anyone living at that time   
         could work out it was Nero," confided IAN DOUGLAS [NTK 2000-
         01-28], probably just to late to halt that "www = Satan" meme
         (eg see this week's Telegraph Connected)... and, sticking with
         archaic communications systems, "Little Computer People was
         also available for the ZX Spectrum, albeit '128K Only',"
         revealed ROD BEGBIE [NTK 2000-02-11], hoping for "a suitably
         disparaging remark about how trainspottery I am for pointing
         this out". Not here Rod, you must have us mistaken for a top
         PlayStation magazine!... ADRIAN MOULDER accused our last "dead
         tree" round-up [NTK 2000-01-28] of omitting "the new Esquire
         ads on the London Underground", where the word "not" in the 
         slogan "THE MEN'S MAGAZINE YOU'RE NOT EMBARRASSED TO READ ON 
         THE TUBE" is both in a different colour and "conveniently 
          positioned for being obliterated by a swift magic marker or   
         piece of gaffa tape", producing the catchier (and still more   
         honest) "THE MEN'S MAGAZINE YOU'RE EMBARRASSED TO READ ON THE  
         TUBE"... but, back with genitals: DYLAN TOMLINSON felt oddly 
         compelled to send us <a href="http://www.ntk.net/2000/02/18/dohbike.gif">http://www.ntk.net/2000/02/18/dohbike.gif</a>
         for our "collection"... and finally, "Why do people think
         vaginal fisting is funny?" asked, er, ANON, in response to the         
         swiftly-deleted Amazon bestseller craze [NTK 2000-02-11],
         "[the book] is terrific, if a touch introductory." (Send us  
         *your* reviews for next week's hard lit round-up!) "Please use
         just my first name, not my company," added a followup mail             
         five minutes later, "Anonymously is even better"...
