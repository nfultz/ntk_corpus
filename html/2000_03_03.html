</span><span class="item">         On Monday, the REGULATION OF INVESTIGATORY POWERS BILL will
         get its second reading in the Commons. Then it goes to
         committee, then it becomes law, and then you'll never hear
         from it again, because talking about most of its powers will
         get you five years in prison. So, when the police ask your
         ISP to put a tap on your mail, you won't hear about it. When
         your local trades and standards officer decides to take a
         look at your browser log for the last month, you won't hear
         about it. And when they come and get your private encryption
         key so that can read your friend's mails, you won't be able
         to tell your friend - or us - that it happened. Hell, you
         won't even be able to change your key if that might give us
         a clue. Given that it's all going to get so quiet so soon,
         STAND thought it might be an idea to let our MPs know that
         we're still here. So, with mild and belated fanfare, please
         welcome - STAND's Open Web to MP fax gateway. Peruse the
         bloody-long-but-not-as-long-as-the-bill STAND Guide to RIP,
         then send your comments on the Bill direct to your
         constituency MP's office with just a few clicks. But please
         be quick - MPs have only ten days from Monday to
         propose their amendments. At the very least, we should get
         an anti-spam statute out of it.

</span><span class="item">         The CONSUMER PROJECT ON TECHNOLOGY's proposal to ICANN that
         the .union top level domain be introduced, as well as
         .isnotfair, .isnotgreen, and .sucks (for official AOL-haters
         sites, and the like) sounds like a joke. Well, that's
         because it is. Or at least, its serious intent is mainly in
         seeing what ICANN's response will be. Previously, ICANN has
         insisted that its function was principally technical: the
         anti-corporate stand taken by these domains is partially an
         attempt to see just how far ICANN can toe the line before
         throwing up their hands and going "Okay, we're molls of the
         international business community, what can we say?". Of
         course, what *might* happen is they'll create those domains,
         AOL et al will buy them all up and then we'll have to pay
         them millions to slag off their own companies. This would
         fit the pattern we're seeing.

         they could ftp Netscape's domestic browser across? A lot of

</span><span class="item">         For those of you who have waited an eponymous duration for
         the Eternity network, FREENET may provide some solace. Both
         have similar aims: a network of machines that provide
         permanent access to anonymously-uploaded documents which
         might otherwise be censored by having servers shut down, or
         the original source traced. Freenet works using a genuinely
         non-hierachical set of nodes which have limited knowledge
         about each other. Send your file to one of them, and
         eventually most of the nodes will be able to relay your file
         to anyone who knows its name. Once the server numbers have
         reached a critical mass over a number of political domains,
         it'll be almost impossible to censor anyone. Server numbers
         is, naturally, where you come in. The first version of the
         GPL'd software is now available for beta-testing: if you
         have a machine permanently connected to the Net and running
         Java 1.1, you too can take place in the first network
         trials. Obligatory strong crypto is to come shortly. And not
         a moment too soon, it would seem.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILMS&gt;&gt; Dave's still away, and our deeply held beliefs
         prevent us from staring too long at Satan's Lantern, so not
         much in the way of films this week. Still, in case you
         didn't already know, director du jour Spike Jonze is the
         serf erased from the publicity for THREE KINGS
         (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a> : Wanton Violence/Crime
         - field impalement to relieve collapsed lung) - what appears
         to be an unnecessary field upgrade of the old Clint Eastwood
         comedy "Kelly's Heroes", sending the message to America's
         "CNN generation" that the Gulf War wasn't just about that
         one laser guided missile zooming down a chimney. No, there
         were the soldiers on the ground doing the real dirty work -
         like performing rectal searches on POWs...  

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; those bastards finally did it - they scheduled a
         widescreen run for THE PLANET OF THE APES movies.  But,
         since you already know the twist, we advise that the only
         way to watch "the Apes" is in chronological order - so tape
         the original (Sat, 20:05, C4) and "BENEATH THE" (Sat, 23:10,
         C4) then watch pseudo-prequel "ESCAPE FROM" (Sun night,
         00:00, C4) and wait for C4 to schedule "BATTLE FOR" and
         "CONQUEST OF" first... it's fairly obvious that scripts for
         the "classics" of TWILIGHT ZONE: ROD STERLING'S LOST
         CLASSICS (Sat night, 00:20, BBC1) were probably "lost" in
         the conical metal "Twilight Zone" in Rod's office...
         continuing Channel 5's perpetual bullshit season: Gilliam's
         THE ADVENTURES OF BARON MUNCHAUSEN (Sun, 16:40, C5) another
         movie cursed by evil, clean-shaven Robin Williams - set
         loose yet again for period stand-up routine GOOD MORNING
         VIETNAM (Mon, 22:00, C4) ... CLONED (Mon, 21:00, C5) is not
         quite the hilarious sci-fi comedy you might have expected
         from the name, then again neither is the similarly titled
         SNL-spinoff CONEHEADS (Tue, 23:55, BBC1) nor indeed the
         hideously misleading FUNNY GAMES (Tue, 23:00, C4) ... and
         more scheduling hilarity as THE X-FILES (Wed, 22:20, BBC1)
         airs against decidedly non-paranormal relationship-docu THE
         EX-FILES (Wed, 22:30, C4) possibly in a bid for that coveted
         "got confused when setting the video-timer" audience-share...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         BOOKZ&gt;&gt; With our Uncharacteristically Generous Literary
         Correspondent, Mr Ben Moor: "Toby Litt has written a cracking
         thriller in CORPSING. Anything that opens in an editing
         suite for the Discovery Channel's Shark Week knows from
         cool. Contains: the best descriptions of bullet trajectories
         since the heyday of Kennedy Assassination literature, and
         great tips on how to ruin Shakespeare at the Barbican...
         Dave Egger's impressively self aware memoir of bringing up
         his 8 year old brother after both his parents died is called
         A HEARTBREAKING WORK OF STAGGERING GENIUS and you kind of
         feel obliged to make some funny comment on the title. He's
         the guy behind Might magazine (which for us defined the
         midearly and then the earlymid nineties) and McSweeneys (
         <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/">http://www.mcsweeneys.net/</a> ) and could be the Tom Wolfe of
         the 21st century if he feels like it. But he probably won't.
         Whatever. Contains: a great stapler drawing... knowing a new
         book by Douglas Coupland is on the way is like being about
         to win at pass the parcel. You're enjoying the suspense of
         waiting, but what if the thing is rubbish? MISS WYOMING
         luckily is very not. There's a very neatly structured story
         that takes you from the madness of child beauty pageants to
         the relative sanity of a movie executive who decides to
         'walk the earth.'... and Dave Barry's BIG TROUBLE is a total
         hoot. If PG Wodehouse had used more and bigger weapons in
         his stories, they'd still only be about half as funny as
         this. Psychedelic toads, water pistols, former Soviet
         armaments, it's got everything a Miami novel needs. Plus
         snakes..."
