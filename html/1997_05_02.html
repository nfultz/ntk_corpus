        prosecutors warned DFN that the left-wing magazine RADIKAL,
        hosted by the site, was illegal under German law. Multiple
        mirroring of the webzine followed. "An effective barrier to the
        illegal content was not possible," a spokesman for the network

        TOMORROW'S WORLD (7.30pm, BBC2) investigates the Israeli _hot
        hedgehog_, a solar power generator which could provide energy
        for the next century, apparently... Mark Lamarr meets US chat
        king David Letterman (the inspiration behind spoofs like Larry
        Sanders, Jonathan Ross and Chris Evans) on PLANET SHOWBIZ
        (8.30pm, C4)... And if you're a fan of Dan Aykroyd and Eddie
        Murphy, then TRADING PLACES (10.35pm, BBC1) is precisely the
        film you deserve...

</span><span class="item">        THURSDAY 8/5/97
        With the passing of their Third Rock From The
        Sun/Horizon double bill, BBC2's Thursday night line-up is
        possibly the worst it's ever been, with only THE PHIL SILVERS
        SHOW (11.55pm, BBC2) enlivening the Quantum Leap/Ab-Fab/This
        Life-induced gloom... And if I'm not mistaken those are
        previously unshown episodes of Tea Leoni's paparazzo sitcom THE
        NAKED TRUTH (11.30pm, C4) tucked away there after Northern
        Exposure without so much as a Cheers repeat to buffer them from
        late-night art films...

</span><span class="item">        THIS WEEK'S NEW MOVIES
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">        SCREAM - Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, Drew Barrymore. Wes
        _Nightmare On Elm St_ Craven's funny, scary, self-referential
        teen slasher homage, currently tying with Jerry Maguire as our
        film of the year so far.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">        DONNIE BRASCO - Al Pacino, Johnny Depp. Acclaimed as-it-really-
        is mob-infiltration drama (apparently based on a true story)
        directed by Mike _Four Weddings And A Funeral_ Newell. But not,
        by any account, a comedy.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">        THE BOY FROM MERCURY - James Hickey, Rita Tushingham. Coming-of-
        age movie about a space-travel-obsessed Irish kid. Not sci-fi
        blockbuster material, perhaps, but might be better than it
        sounds.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">        LIAR, LIAR - Jim Carrey, Jennifer Tilly. A typically
        unrestrained Carrey (playing a lawyer) is forced to tell the
        truth for a day, in entertaining slapstick that re-teams him
        with Ace Ventura director Tom Shadyac.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">        MARGARET'S MUSEUM - Helena Bonham Carter. Tragic romance set
        among the coal-mining communities of Nova Scotia. Settle down at
        the back there.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">        IT TAKES TWO - Steve Guttenberg, Kirstie Alley. Identical twins
        contrive to match-make their widowed parents (one rich, one
        poor) in lame feel-good nonsense.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">        FEMALE PERVERSIONS - Tilda Swinton. Arty meanderings on the
        nature of feminity, probably without the gratuitous sex and
        nudity that the poster mildly implies.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">        OTHER
        Phill Jupitus performs his oh-so-unlicensed Star Wars spoof JEDI
        STEADY GO at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith on Sunday. Hilarious,
        we're sure, but would you pay 7.50 upwards to see a stand-up who
        is under the impression that the word _Jedi_ rhymes with
        _Steady_?...
