          In comparison to other process-oriented industries, the meat 
          industry had a lot of catching up to do before it arrives at a 
          highly integrated functional system. "We have now plugged this 
          gap with myMEAT," [Jan Grutter] remarks proudly....

          wunderkinder CHARLIE BROOKER, father of TV Go Home, NTK 
          irregular, creator of Nathan Barley, maker of (corporate 
          shields up! pr0n filters on stun!) "Cunt", was picked off
          in a hail of lone typists acting online this week, for
          concluding his Guardian TV review of the US presidential
          debates with a reference to Lee Harvey Oswald, John Hinckley
          and the other people you put in the standard "Come back
          $PERSON, all is forgiven!" graffiti joke.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">          The Guardian, in its fine tradition of boldness in the face
          of adversity, instantly took down the column and replaced it
          with an apology. But, as the servers struggle to keep up
          with the bad-teeth-citing, lime-despising, sure-kicked-your-
          ass-in-the-late-18th-Century barrage, we remain charmed by 
          one thing: Proper Media still counts.

                                                        redistributes it
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">          Because Brooker may write in a paper, but he still posts
          like he was on a newsgroup. You do know what they're saying 
          on IRC, right? Do you read what the little green forums of 
          the world spit out on a daily basis? Have you seen the
          Indymediots, the Freepers, the lists, the feeds, the
          unmoderated masses? Do you remember what you yourself wrote
          *last night*? You've heard the Bush jokes, the Kerry jokes,
          the Blair jokes: are we supposed to take all of those
          seriously, too?

</span><span class="item">          Yes, it's all serious now. But one day, we'll look back and
          laugh. We'll watch Dad's Reservist Army, and visit the Twin
          Towers Vegas attraction, and the guy in the giant Osama head
          will ask us to recall that time when people stayed up at
          night, staring at their dim screens, and darker forums,
          threatening to do more than JUST TYPE IN ANGRY CAPS during
          The Great Trolling. Ah, hell, here's to next week, when we
          all tap on reload, watching that grey bar of progress of
          inch across the screen, then sticking, as it always does, at
          49%. HAND.

          the exhibitors (eg "Anglia Classic Computer Users Society will
          be selling keyboard membranes on behalf of RWAP Software") can
          always just sell stuff to each other, as happened from time to

          don't pour over your apache logs, gleefully pouncing on
          referrers, chortle over your keh-razy Google search terms,
          tracing your rise up the blogrolls to Supreme
          Google-Juicity. That would be *vain*. As a matter of fact,
          you don't even have a weblog statistics analyser installed.
          But you do concede it would be nice to just take a cursory
          glance across the last /var/log/apache/access_log file.
          Perhaps even, as in that last slashdotting, to get an HTML
          summary in real time, counting up the hits as they happen.
          Enter VISITORS, the ironically ungoogleable name of a C
          executable that's fast enough to just run over your logs
          when you need it, raw enough to generate a text summary to
          STDOUT, and small enough to sit listening to a piped "tail
          -f" of your logs, generating HTML on the fly. The code is
          portable with no dependencies, so you don't even have to
          install it. No-one need know you care.

          remains a highlight of the as-you'd-expect AMERICAN PIE 2 
          (9pm, Wed, ITV)... HORIZON (9pm, Thu, BBC2) tackles the tricky 
          issue of nature vs nurture in the sensitively titled "Dr Money

          something with a terrestrial premier double bill of TOUCHING

          improbable MEMENTO (11.05pm, Thu, C4) - dense anterograde

</span><span class="geekmedia">          FILM&gt;&gt; Izabella "Reign of Fire" Scorupco is sworn in as the 
          new "Pazuzu" in unnecessary prequel EXORCIST: THE BEGINNING 
        ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/exorcistthebeginning.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/exorcistthebeginning.htm</a> :
          If you are bothered by seeing a human body atomized into tiny 
          pieces and another body with a 10-inch hole eaten through its 
          midsection with about half the flesh gone from the rest of the 
          body, this film is not for you)... also out on limited release 
          this Friday is the scariest Halloween sociopath of them all - 
          aka THE CORPORATION ( <a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/">http://www.bbfc.co.uk/</a> : Cert PG, 
          contains images of real violence and death)... then next week, 
          Sarah Michelle Gellar avoids stereotyping as a young woman 
          battling supernatural forces in Japanese horror remake THE 
          GRUDGE ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/grudge_the.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/grudge_the.htm</a> : 
          human mandible; adults in underwear; mutilated walking undead; 
          at least seven murders and one suicide; Buddhism)... and sure, 
          we admit there are *a few* funny moments amid the endless, 
          brutal misanthropy of Billy Bob Thornton's predictably BAD 
          SANTA ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307987/trivia">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0307987/trivia</a> : the word 
          "fuck" and its variations are used 147 times while "shit" 
          appears 34 times - possibly a record for a Christmas film)...
