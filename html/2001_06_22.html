the probabilistic gossip email - 22.06.01  *issue 0.75*
statistically uncorrelated with <a href="http://www.popbitch.com">http://www.popbitch.com</a>

This week:

* Pop singers, TV presenters, soap stars - do they TAKE DRUGS?

* Does listening to Bryan Adams make you a serial killer?

* Exclusive: the Daphne and Celeste/Hitler connection

Plus "predicted chart positions", obtained via the amazingly 
clairvoyant method of TYPING IN THE MID-WEEK CHART POSITIONS 
FAXED TO THE MUSIC PRESS EVERY WEDNESDAY 
</span><span class="item_space">------------------------------------------------------

</span><span class="item">     Statistically speaking, almost 50% of MALE ROCK STARS have 
     genitals which are larger than average, assuming that by 
     "average", we are referring to the precise arithmetic mean, 
     rather than the mode or the median. At the same time, the 
     other 50% have genitals which are almost all *smaller* than 
     average. Either way - unusually large (or small) genitals! 
     I mean, HOW FREAKY IS THAT?
</span><span class="item_space">     
</span><span class="item">     Chances are, ANY CELEBRITY YOU CAN THINK OF - or someone close 
     to them - will have taken illegal drugs at some point, 
     especially if you define "close" as "within 20 miles". Experts 
     blame high showbiz incomes, a possible inherent insecurity in 
     those drawn to the performing arts, and, most worryingly of 
     all, a "culture of conspicuous consumption" prevalent in 
     modern-day Western society!
</span><span class="item_space">     
</span><span class="item">     Exclusive: DAPHNE AND CELESTE are both related to Adolph 
     Hitler, self-appointed "Fuhrer" of the Third Reich, in a 
     vaguely tangential manner. Sophisticated DNA analysis has 
     proved that all humans share the same basic genetic material 
     (this being part of the definition of a biological "species"), 
     even despicable Nazi dictators and cuddly female pop stars. 
     Talk about 6 degrees of separation!
</span><span class="item_space">     
</span><span class="item">     Which past-it pop bands could be "dropped" by their record 
     companies very soon, unless their next records do particularly 
     well? Astonishingly, it's ALL OF THEM - many acts have been 
     signed up on "contracts" for a pre-specified duration (or 
     number of albums), agreements which can eventually be 
     "terminated" if either party changes their mind!
</span><span class="item_space">     
</span><span class="item">     Exactly how many BRYAN ADAMS fans might turn out to be serial 
     killers? Probably no more than those of any other reasonably 
     well-known musician with broad international appeal, but 
     still, it could be more than you think! 
</span><span class="item_space">     
</span><span class="item">     And, while we're on the subject, exactly how many serial 
     killers might turn out to be BRYAN ADAMS fans? Probably no 
     more than those of any other reasonably well-known musician 
     with broad international appeal, but still, it could be more 
     than you think!

     "extremely unlikey" that, after a successful stint in a B-list
     boy-band, both JAMES BULGER murderers plan to pursue careers as
     light entertainment presenters in children's TV. "Friends Like

         if not all, of their creative and production staff", the site

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; BBC1 wheels out yet another interchangeable love-and-
         deceit-among-a-posh-family-who-live-in-the-past drama THE 
         CAZALETS (9pm, Fri, BBC1)... SOUTH PARK (10pm, Fri, C4) 
         replaces "Frasier" with the year-old "Tooth Fairy" episode 
         anachronistically featuring a Dreamcast - and what happened to 
         "Cartman's Silly Hate Crime 2000", listed by some as the first 
         of season 4?... while the amusingly named Jon Snow rehashes 
         the same old boring arguments in DRUGS LAWS ON TRIAL (6.30pm, 
         Sat, C4) - hey, if they legalise narcotics, who do you think 
         the military-industrial complex are going to go after instead? 
         ... film of the week is the-clue's-in-the-title hilariously 
         Capra-esque mild-Charlize-Theron-nudity parable THE DEVIL'S 
         ADVOCATE (9pm, Sat, BBC1)... a tough night ahead for William 
         Petersen, battling forensic mysteries in CSI (8.05pm, Sat, C5) 
         and Marky Mark Wahlberg in FEAR (11.20pm, Sat, ITV)... and 
         "Machines have made us the only animal that can exceed its 
         natural speed limit", reckons SPEED (8pm, Sun, BBC1), ignoring 
         the famous counter-example of a cow pushed off a cliff... we 
         could be wrong, but WORLD OF PUB (9.50pm, Sun, BBC2) outwardly 
         resembles a remake of Sky's "Time Gentlemen Please", but with 
         Kevin "Simon Quinlank" Eldon instead of The Pub Landlord, and 
         Phil Cornwell instead of Phil Daniels... it's back to familiar 
         ground for C5 with Rutger Hauer thriller BONE DADDY (9pm, Sun, 
         C5) plus Mario Van Peebles "Terminator" knock-off SOLO (9pm, 
         Tue, C5) - both last shown June 2000 - though BBC1 stays in 
         the running with alternate reality sequel THE PHILADELPHIA 
         EXPERIMENT 2 (11.35pm, Wed, BBC1)... while C5 re-iterates its 
         commitment to factual educational programming with two new 
         tech shows, the self-explanatory WWW.SEX (11.05pm, Thu, C5) as 
         well as DOWNLOADED (11.35pm, Thu, C5), the latter being an 
         animation showcase hosted by experienced Flash programmers 
         Trevor and Simon...

         ineffectual biological body-horror, ineptly remakes his own 
         "Ghostbusters" in scientifically incompetent CGI showreel 
         EVOLUTION (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/evolution.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/evolution.htm</a> : 
         crotch hit with further attention to the male crotch; rear 
         male [Duchovny] nudity; homosexual joke/insult; attempt to 
         strip to underwear - female; entire theme based on evolution; 
         revelry). Features a baffling scene where Duchovny announces 
         the military have taken "all the jpegs" off his PC - but left 
         the other image formats intact?... or a couple of bedsit 
         Brit-movies, with Juliette "Natural Born Killers" Lewis 
         inexplicably popping up in gay Egyptian flatshare curio ROOM 
         TO RENT (<a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk">http://www.bbfc.co.uk</a> : passed '15' for strong 
         language, moderate sex and sexual references)... plus almost-
         Glaswegian-accent-free Scottish "Clerks" knock-off LATE NIGHT 
         SHOPPING (<a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk">http://www.bbfc.co.uk</a> : strong language and moderate 
         sexual references) - that bloke from "I'm Alan Partridge" and 
         the Archers and Wrigleys ads, that bloke from the "One2One" 
         stalker ad from a couple of years ago, and Nigel from 4later's 
         "Vids" - together at last!... 
         
         ADVERTS THAT SOUND LIKE WELL-KNOWN POP SONGS, SONGS THAT SOUND 
</span><span class="geekmedia">         LIKE OTHER SONGS, AND THE OWNERS THAT LOVE THEM&gt;&gt; yup, you 
         don't need a degree in forensic musicology to spot that "Sing" 
         by TRAVIS sounds like their previous monsyllabic imperative 
         "Turn", combined with everything else they've ever done 
         (while, confusingly, the chorus of "Turn" by FEEDER sounds 
         just like "Ordinary World" by DURAN DURAN), but only DANIEL 
         BUTT cared enough to notice that "Take Your Carriage Clock And 
         Shove It", the B-side to BELLE &amp; SEBASTIAN's new "Johnathan 
         David" single, is "an absolute rip-off" of chart-topper "I've 
         Never Been To Me" by CHARLENE (for which our favourite gag 
         remains: "Things a woman isn't supposed to see? How about the 
         exact time and manner of her own death? No-one likes seeing 
         that")... increasingly obscurely, the "noodling guitar chorus" 
         of the TURIN BRAKES single "Underdog (Save Me)" (recently 
         charting, with a bullet, at no. 39) reminded DAVID MILLINGTON 
         of THE FARM's "Groovy Train", while PAUL TAYLOR, apparently 
         not confusing it with SHAGGY's more openly derivative "Angel", 
         accused WHEATUS' "Teenage Dirtbag" of lifting its whole rhythm 
         section from STEVE MILLER's "The Joker". "Teenage Dirtbag" is 
         of course the track in which Radio 1 currently censor the line 
         "he brings a gun to school", while also refusing to give the 
         full name of WEEZER's "Hash Pipe" (calling it "H Pipe" 
         instead), much to the disappointment of fans of associative 
         arrays... the individual known only as "h0l" thought we might 
         like the "live bootleg gorgeousness" of comedy cover-fiends MR 
         BUNGLE's version of the "Zelda Theme", complete with lyrics: 
         <a href="ftp://mirror.support.nl/pub/mono/drfetid/zeldab.zip">ftp://mirror.support.nl/pub/mono/drfetid/zeldab.zip</a> ; MOP's 
         "Ante Up" album track constitutes, we believe, the most 
         blatant use of Defender samples in a hip-hop tune so far; and 
         an, er, ANONYMOUS TIPSTER revealed that the backing track to 
         the new trailer for PS2 Halflife "desperately, urgently, 
         hideously, absolutely needs to sound like Block Rockin' Beats, 
         by the CHEMICAL BROTHERS"... also in ads, NICK DRAGE thought 
         "parts of" <a href="http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/11/_hate_dept.html">http://artists.mp3s.com/artists/11/_hate_dept.html</a> 
         "sound awfully like the music from the Hula Hoops advert set 
         in a disco"; "the music from the Sugar Puffs secret agent 
         advert is quite clearly meant to be DAVID ARNOLD's reworking 
         of 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service'", reported PHIL MURG, 
         cryptically adding "You'd think they'd be able to afford the 
         real thing seeing as they don't have to pay Henry McGee's 
         salary any more"; and thanks to all of you (well, DERREN D 
         PHILLIPS, anyway) who wrote in explaining why we won't be 
         hearing the MANICS' "Ocean Spray" in any cranberry juice 
         adverts any time soon [as hypothesised in NTK 2001-05-11]:

         - though we maintain that if their next album features a close 
         relative poignantly passing away while attired in clothes from 
         The Gap, then we'll be suspicious...
