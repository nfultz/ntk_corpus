</span><span class="item">         APPLE COMPUTER increased its share of the lucrative
         "foundationless gossip" industry this week, with excellent
         results. The first we heard was from our Hot Apple Source,
         who sent the cryptic "We hear our female execs are in for a
         few Lexuses". Next, weirdness spilled forth from Amiga-
         eater GATEWAY 2000: was their resigning CEO Apple-bound?
         The Tuesday SF Chronicle said Steve Jobs as chairman was a
         done deal, and then the excellent MacOS Rumours site maxed
         out after hinting a Sun-Oracle buyout. Apple stocks bounced
         up all week - and Apple still hadn't had to do a thing. We
         can only note that PC Pro's news page headlined with
         "Apple's job of jobs could be the job for Jobs", implying a
         joke that got out of hand. Slightly more usefully, someone
         leaked Jobs' e-mail to his Pixar employees denying
         everything. You know, it's a sad world when the only guy
         whose word you believe is Steve Jobs.

</span><span class="item">         "Computers need more Africa in them" said Brian Eno,
         misquoting Lenny Henry's Theophilus P Wildebeest. Others
         plan the exact reverse. MICROSOFT this week announced their
         intent to invest millions in (as they pointedly describe
         it) "building an African market for its products". And
         where Microsoft stomps, can NEGROPONTE be far behind? Old
         Nick's son, Dmitri, has just wrapped up the first 2B1
         conference, where children from developing countries were
         invited to learn about the Digital Revolution(tm) at MIT.
         "We're trying to bypass the politicians," Dmitri, 27, says.
         Sadly, the history of young people being taught a novel
         ideology by confused Western academics and then returning
         to their communities to create their own unique
         interpretation is *not* too good these days. Meanwhile, the
         eminently practical clockwork inventor, Trevor Bayliss,
         premiered a clockwork Newton for Commonwealth officials. It
         can, reports say, run for over 16 minutes without crashing.

         net.ne'er-do-wells. Under the benevolent gaze of new
         Internet Minister Barbara Roche, power passed into the
         eminently trustworthy, cough cough, hands of Demon,
         LineOne, UUNet and BT, who are now sponsoring it, and the
         LINX and the Internet Service Providers Association (ISPA),
         who will be assisting in a general revamp. The group has
         ambitious plans, including hosting the first international
         working group on rating and filtering software. It's not
         clear whether all this will still take place around Dawe's
         kitchen table - like in the good old days.

</span><span class="item">         The newspaper tech pages were abuzz (well, as abuzz as the
         tech pages get) with a doom-laden study that declared that
         the Net was suffering from a bandwidth "crisis of the
         Commons". The Xerox Parc research team based their findings
         on timing packets between Stanford and the UK's Cranfield
         Uni (lot of traffic there). They noted from the delays that
         when users are encouraged by fast response times, they
         increase their net activities. When the response time then
         slows to a crawl, users back off. The researchers' were
         horrified by this "feast-and-famine" scenario, and
         suggested charging everyone for bandwidth used to stamp it
         out. Fine. Now given that's never going to happen, how
         about a better set of Internet weather indicators, so this
         "crisis" (or "equilibrium-seeking system" as we'd more
         positively describe it) can be fine-tuned? Oh shut up, us.

         appealingly titled Theoretical Archaeology Group ("Go and
         dig something up!" "I'll think about it") are calling for
         papers for December's even cooler-sounding conference: WHEN
         WORLDS COLLIDE: ARCHAEOLOGY AND SCIENCE FICTION. "More
         people have seen Raiders Of The Lost Ark than Time Team,"
         ponders dashing academic Miles Russell, adding: "Can we
         learn anything from the popular perception of archaeology
         in the public consciousness? Are those involved in
         archaeology secretly pleased by the heroic pose of Indiana
         Jones, Jean-Luc Picard or Lara Croft?" Shamefully, we only
         found out about this via the chat-forum for the launch of
         new mag CULT TV, an event marred by troublemakers
         discussing the allegedly made-up kids' show, CANOE SQUAD.

         or conspiracy, both RU SIRIUS and HEATH BUNTING are in

         Irational.org's messings with the loyalty card schemes of

</span><span class="item">         MICROSOFT snuck out the V1.2 "upgrade" for its notorious
         DIAL-UP NETWORKING support this week. Preeeetty featureful:
         client support for point-to-point tunneling protocol is
         introduced, letting Win 95 users connect to NT servers over
         the Net instead of direct-dialling in. Plus there's support
         for internal ISDN adapters and extra scripting commands.
         All this, and a less buggy TCP/IP stack too! Wonder why
         they're keeping it so quiet?

         comedy's most obvious objects of mirth, though that doesn't
         include tonight's guest, Jeremy Clarkson... "Beavis And
         Butthead meets The Simpsons" is how one traditionally
         cheers cartoon trash-com KING OF THE HILL (10.30pm, Fri,
         C4)... THE GAME OF WAR (8pm, Sun, C4) sounds like a TV
         tourney of Command And Conquer, but BBC2 has the real thing
         in Moviedrome's urban unrest double-bill THE WARRIORS and
         LA HAINE (from 10.15pm, Sun, BBC2)... no-one seems much
         shocked by the new drugs/youth/road-protesters strand
         they're calling RENEGADE TV (from 11pm, Mon) on, you've
         guessed it, Channel 4... the Tomorrow's World team use
         archive nostalgia to deny that appearing on their show
         "curses" inventions in TW TIME MACHINE (7.30pm, Wed,
         BBC1)... INSIDE STORY (10pm, Wed, BBC2) tries to get inside
         the "containers" of the Heaven's Gate suicide HTML cult,
         tastefully followed by two X FILES, the second of which is
         the cool one with the circus freaks... Tarantino geek-
         cameos near the end of fun but patchy 20-something drama
         SLEEP WITH ME (10.35pm, Thu, C4), but REBOOT (4.40pm, Thu,
         ITV) interrupts with an "Is Enzo dead?" cliffhanger, though

         the effects of an ID4-style blockbuster, but just hasn't
         got the *soul*, and consequently feels short, empty,
         insubstantial, like a cheaper Ghostbusters 2... it's
         unclear if its title is supposed to be funny but B*A*P*S
         (Halle Berry, Martin Landau - it stands for "Black American
         Princesses") may be the worst film released so far this
         year... which leaves us with surprise recommendation
         ADDICTED TO LOVE (Matthew Broderick, Meg Ryan), an often
         dumb but at least bizarrely obsessive romantic comedy

         at <a href="http://www.mitt.demon.co.uk">www.mitt.demon.co.uk</a>) by foolhardily plugging it in The
         Guardian last weekend. Apparently Demon will suspend any
         homepage shifting more than "100 megabytes transferred to
         non-Demon hosts for any three days in a month". So now you
         know, you warez, porn, or kids' TV barons. As penance, NTK
         is currently working with host Moose to transfer the
         offender to a better, fatter-piped home. We're fairly sure
         we didn't cause the firing of Tinky Winky (aka the
         Nietzschean Cluub Zarathustra's Dave Thompson). In
         addition, a letter in this month's issue of The Face
         reveals that Tinky Winky (the Teletubbie, not the actor) is
         probably gay - rather than transvestite, as we may have
         previously claimed. NTK regrets all these errors.
