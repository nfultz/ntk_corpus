</span><span class="item">         Elections for the ICANN nomination pool end today. And like
         any other pool, it looks like the Germans got there first.
         Thanks to a prolonged campaign by the German press (and less
         assiduous Europeans' tendency not to not pogo-ing reload all
         day on the ICANN registration form), the Teutonic tendency
         has leapfrogged their European counterparts. Rest easy,
         though, little Englander: the nominee uber alles so far
         turns out to be ANDY MUELLER-MAGUHN, smartcard-cracking
         speaker of the infamously pro-liberty CHAOS COMPUTER CLUB.
         Ceterus paribus, and assuming constant apathy in the other
         continents, the real election for the precious two board
         seats should go to him and everyone-but-Microsoft's favourite
         pet legal eagle LAWRENCE LESSIG. And while the real TLD
         decisions will continue to be made by chuckling corporate
         lawyers in closed hotel rooms and conference calls, at least
         we'll have one member who has might just install Back
         Orifice on their machines. In the interests of civic
         transparency, naturlich.

</span><span class="item">         Continuing the jocular racism: what about those French, hey?
         Blocking our ports and jamming our tunnels like the
         overzealous firewall admins they so vividly resemble. As a
         race. All of them. All the time. Anyway, after the French
         stranded thousands of holidaymakers and effectively held
         their own entire country to ransom, it's up to Britain's own
         "Expo Protest Team" to show them some *real* direct action,
         by disrupting Steve Job's keynote at the Paris Mac show next
         week. The group says that they're pissed off at Apple's
         treatment of its UK customers, pissed off at the legalling
         of Mac gossip sites, pissed off that the London Apple show
         was cancelled, and pissed off that Steve Jobs still wears a
         cheesy grin when they're still forking over thousands for
         the latest Apple glittercake. The causal link between the
         last grievance and the rest appears not to have occurred to
         them as yet. The group has its half-baking supporters: "If
         Apple is just another corporation existing solely for the
         purpose of making money, what is 'Think Different' all about
         anyway?", wrote The Mac Junkie's Charles Moore, his own
         penny slowly beginning to drop. But the protestors should
         beware. Those "Steve Jobs Dancers" in the background may
         look harmless, but everyone knows they can pole-ax a heckler
         at fifty paces - as Wired News reports "the protesters may
         be clubbed like baby seals if they dare to interrupt his
         spiel".

         "fixed it" so that irrepressible Brit-comedy criticism site
         SOME OF THE CORPSES ARE AMUSING has disappeared. Frankly, we
         have no idea why, though readers of rec.arts.tv.uk.comedy
         may recall that their forums were one of the very best
         places to discuss the mysterious origins of the HOAX JIMMY

         rounds back in July. But, hey, SOTCAA's stringent (and now
         mildly ironic) anti-censorship stance could have made them
         any number of powerful enemies in the UK laughter-biz: who
         could forget, for instance, their hard-hitting parody of the

         itself as "the cheaper, less controversial alternative to
         Apple Expo Paris" (see this week's news) - though you've got
         to agree, as little as UKP18 (advance ticket price) for 3
         days of software publishers flogging you half-arsed
         "creativity tools" surely represents *remarkable* value for
         money. Guests on the "main stage" are largely a bunch of
         Nathanic has-beens - out-evolved organic graphics guru
         WILLIAM LATHAM, pompous fools TOMATO - though we're pleased
         to note the attendance of no less than *2* "PETER SCOTT"s:
         one presumably the cheap CGI pioneer behind C5's "Too Much

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Just when you thought they'd drowned for good, our favourite
         low-tide low-technicians, Backspace.org, are back with a
         brand new gig. As befits their more virtual status these
         days, they working on a plan to jerry-rig a
         dynamically-routed, 2400Mhz, 802.11 wireless network across
         as much of London as they can muster. Judging from previous
         efforts in this arena, it's not quite as simple project as
         it looks - the 802.11b standard is a bit rubbish at coping
         with bridges between wired networks, security is probably
         going to require some messing around with IPsec, and
         according to the letter of the law it's all a little bit
         wayyy: a little bit tasty. Still, with the price of 2MB
         wireless cards plummetting and with a few good people
         already involved, maybe now's the time. They'll need help,
         though. So if you're somebody with kernel driver-hacking
         experience, or you can do more than pretend to understand
         routing, or you've ever done things to your rig of which the
         Radiocommunications Agency would not approve, or you simply
         don't mind hiding a 486 laptop up on your roof give them a
         buzz. If nothing else, the interference will piss off those
         snooty Apple Airport owners. And that's all we can ask of
         any community effort.

         titled 100 GREATEST TV MOMENTS FROM HELL (9pm, Sat, C4)...
         Carrie Fisher declares I LOVE 1977 (9pm, Sat, BBC2), fondly
         recalling "Saturday Night Fever", "Star Wars" and, on a more
         personal level, vast quantities of cocaine... and for the
         meme-complex who wrote in complaining it "kept missing"
         Richard Dawkins' MIND BITES on Saturday mornings, there's a
         repeat of his 5- minute musings on science fiction (10am,
         Sat, BBC2)... TWENTY FOUR SEVEN (10pm, Sun, BBC2) answers
         the largely unasked question "What would 'Fight Club' be
         like if had it starred Bob Hoskins and been set in
         Nottingham?"... a double-dose of Victor Lewis-Smith infects
         both ADS INFINITUM (9.50pm, Mon, BBC2) and nerd garbologist
         docu SCANDAL IN THE BINS (10pm, Mon, C4)... C4 spins its
         "Monday Night Nam Movie" chamber and - click! - it's THE
         DEER HUNTER (11.05pm, Mon, C4)... while Sky, as is their
         wont, stick all their new shows into an undistinguished
         weeknight slot: HARRY ENFIELD'S BRAND SPANKING NEW SHOW
         (10pm, Sky1, Mon); Al Murray's TIME GENTLEMEN PLEASE
         (10.30pm, Sky1) - "the best thing [Rich Herring] has ever
         written"; and critically acclaimed import TITUS (11pm, Sky1)
         - which is the sitcom that last week's Anthony Hopkins movie
         isn't based on, or vice-versa... frankly we're more excited
         about about the return of STARSHIP TROOPERS: THE ANIMATED
         SERIES (7am &amp; 3pm, Mon-Fri, Sky1)... supporting the theory
         that they've accidentally swapped movie schedules, C5 are
         showing nice-but-dull GROSSE POINT BLANK (9pm, Tue, C5)
         while C4 woos its arthouse crowd with SCANNER COP (2.35am,
         Sat, C4) - which spawned its own short-lived franchise, in
         the form of "Scanner Cop II: Volkin's Revenge"... and in
         another piece of genius acquistion, C4 commence showing
         shockingly good Buffy spin-off ANGEL (6pm, Fri) - here's
         hoping they somehow manage to sync up those vital crossover
         episodes with BBC2...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; meticulously spoofing the "Scream" films, right down
         to losing it about half-way through, comes the impressively
         rude SCARY MOVIE (<a href="http://www.screenit.com">http://www.screenit.com</a> : spoilers for
         most of the gags, <a href="http://www.cndb.com">http://www.cndb.com</a> : "Carmen Electra runs
         through a water sprinkler in her bra and panties in slow
         motion [...] Luckily she decided to wear a thong for this
         awesome scene. So we see her nice ass!"; "[shower-scene]
         girl (unknown) revels her breasts after taking off her
         towel"; "only one scene comes close to nudity for the
         incredibly cute [Anna] Faris [...] you see her bare butt
         [...] huge torrent of her boyfriend's semen [...] it's
         possible this is a dummy, or maybe even a stunt/ body double
         [...] We'll have to wait for the DVD to find out for
         sure")... which, frankly, should see off the competition
         from Barry Levinson's rather less graphic 1950s-set Jewish-
         American coming-of-ager LIBERTY HEIGHTS (imdb: /
         independent- film / anti-semitism / baltimore /
         numbers-racket / premature- ejaculation / race-relations)...
         some Oirish romantic nonsense THE CLOSER YOU GET
         (<a href="http://www.screenit.com/">http://www.screenit.com/</a> : Profanity is rated as heavy due
         to 1 use of the "f" word)... plus John Turturro, Emily
         Watson and Vladimir Nabokov - together at last! - in THE
         LUZHIN DEFENCE (imdb comment: A brilliant, visually stunning
         film about the madness of big time chess)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FEAR OF A BLANK NAPSTER&gt;&gt; rapidly developing a taste in MP3s
         that can only be described as "near-random", unofficial NTK
         music critic ADRIAN MOULDER has compiled an epic list of
         recent pop soundalikes, attributing RICHARD ASHCROFT's
         "C'mon People" to "Reach Out (I'll Be There)" by The Four
         Tops, DAVID GRAY's "Babylon" to "Breakfast At Tiffany's" by
         Deep Blue Something and, perhaps most improbably of all,
         "the new STEPS single" to Europe's "The Final Countdown". He
         goes on to plead for "a reassessment of pioneering '90s
         girl-popsters SHAMPOO", having "invented both the expression
         'Girl Power' and, in their song 'Delicious', BILLIE's
         catchphrase 'Because We Want To'" - a defence, you've got to
         admit, it would be tempting to try in Billie's current
         court-case: "Why did you say you'd have my client killed?
         Because I wanted to! Because I wanted to!"... we've been
         investigating the hypocritical world of TV/ radio
         censorship, noting that foul-mouthed Yanks EMINEM and THE
         BLOODHOUND GANG don't seem to be allowed to say "ass" (eg in
         the Bloodhounds' new "Ballad Of Chasey Lain"), even though
         cheeky Brit ROBBIE WILLIAMS has been (eg in "Let Me
         Entertain You"), and now gets away with "Give no head, no
         backstage passes" in "Rock DJ". It doesn't seem to be
         entirely pro- British, however, as the BBC cut promotional
         references to "Channel 4" and "MTV" from Richard Blackwood's
         recent "Who The Man", while permitting the
         ever-controversial Bloodhound Gang to extensively plug The
         Discovery Channel on their previous single. Evidently,
         clearer guidelines are required!... and, finally, an answer
         for MARTIN WHITE who, after reading our "Where Are They
         Now?" on Zero Magazine back in NTK 2000-03-10, wrote to say
         that "[child techno genius] DANIEL PEMBERTON came round my
         house one day six years ago and promised me he'd write the
         music for my first film.  Do you know how I can get in touch
         with him?" Well, he mails us all the time, Martin - about a
         month ago with the startling revelation that "the whole Big
         Brother thing is a scam - it's never actually been on TV in
         these other countries before". "The whole thing is
         scripted," Pembo alleges, "[and] will start off quite normal
         [...] but it's going to end one week early in a horrific
         bloodbath as one of them goes nuts with the kitchen knife
         killing three of the remainding people and then himself -
         ALL ON 'LIVE' TV! Everyone will think it's real - C4 will
         only announce the next week it wasn't." "I didn't tell you
         this," he concludes, "but trust me: this is the new 'Ghostwatch'".
         As a composer widely respected by the Space: 1999 fan community
         <a href="http://www.newsgate.co.uk/uk/uk.media.tv.sf.misc/msg00050.html">http://www.newsgate.co.uk/uk/uk.media.tv.sf.misc/msg00050.html</a>
         Daniel's media credentials are, of course, impeccable -
         though we haven't seen this "Big Brother" show ourselves, so
         please do let us know if it ends in some hideous bloodbath,
         just in case the mainstream media miss that episode or
         something...
