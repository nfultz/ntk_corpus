</span><span class="item">        It's all gone a bit Le Carre around here. Most have now
        heard the story of DAVID MERY, the techie arrested and
        searched for being geeky in a terroristic manner, and later
        documented on the Guardian front page and Slashdot.
        Initially, we thought Mery's treatment was a cover for the
        police to confiscate a BeBox for themselves, but now we're
        growing more concerned. Few know the pivotal role the
        notorious pataphysicist Mery has played in the seedy
        underworld of tech journalism: editor of the samizdat .EXE
        Magazine; one of the few to have ever met that Mata Hari of
        TurboPascal, Verity Stob; rare familiar of both NTK and
        Andrew "Spart" Orlowski. Was Mery's handling a warning to
        the British IT journalist community to keep their mouths
        shut? And if it wasn't, is there any way we can get them to
        do it anyway?

</span><span class="item">        While scientists valiantly warn of the pandemic spread of
        the DRM flu, has anyone considered that innocent-seeming
        CORY DOCTOROW might be an unsuspecting carrier? After years
        of close physical contact with the biohazardous hands of
        MPAA lawyers during the brief Broadcast Flag outbreak of
        2004, he now seems to have been in *just* the right spot to
        see the pestilence jump the species barrier to European
        Digital TV. And this variant seems a lot nastier: tweaked by
        Hollywood lawyers to determine at a much finer grain what
        Europeans get to record off their TVs, where you get to save
        it, what constitutes a "family", and who exactly in open
        source will be buggered this time. And while the American
        Broadcast Flag appears now to be at least temporarily
        cordoned off in a batch of carefully isolated politicians,
        this European "CPCM" mutation looks to be spreading through
        the sprawling, marshy standard bodies endemic to the European
        continent. Will we live in a locked-down, quarantined TV
        world? Or are we *insufficiently paranoid*?

        British tang to <a href="http://www.ning.com">www.ning.com</a>, with many of the Brit Web 1.9
        crowd's usual suspects involved in designing the API, site
        and developer "evangelism" (which we sincerely hope will be
        renamed "developers having tea at the vicarage"). But will
        imported labour help Ning escape the Curse of Marca? Sure,
        the site's "View Web App Source" model picks out the clever
        bit of Marc's last good implementation, and should go some
        way to reassuring all these picky Web developers who expect
        their software to be free and Free. But how comfortable will
        they be, trusting all their data to the loving arms of
        Ning's singleton, proprietary OODB? Will coders only be
        happy when some bright FOSS spark has re-implemented their
        own half-baked Ning-a-like in a way that lets you run it on
        your own machines, for no money, and with GPL v3 Free
