</span><span class="item">         NASA's Cassini probe failed to deliver its expected payload
         of 72 pounds of plutonium to the people of Florida on
         Wednesday. Embarrassed officials admitted that the probe,
         which cost $1.2 billion dollars, is now instead en route to
         irradiate evolving lifeforms on the moons of Saturn, some
         2 billion miles off the predicted course. Cassini, one of
         NASA's last "large, slow, and please God not out of
         control" projects, has only one more chance to devastate
         Earth when it returns for a final swingby of America in
         August 1999. It will then be travelling at 43,000 miles an
         hour, at a distance of about 500 miles above the planet's
         surface - coincidentally about the same distance as Bill
         Gate's Teledesic satellites (let's hope he's contracted out
         the navigation software). Apart from the lethally toxic
         isotope, the satellite also carries a CD-ROM with 600,000
         signatures from well-wishers, although NASA look unlikely
         to refer to it as "the probe that has your name on it"
         until way past Mars.

</span><span class="item">         Those loony Eurocrats have done it again! In another insane
         set of inpenetrable and imperious directives, they've
         announced that restricting strong encryption "could well
         prevent law-abiding companies and citizens from protecting
         themselves against criminal attacks", and that the US's
         favoured key escrow system would give criminals "additional
         ways to break into a cryptographic system." Also, they're
         looking at investigating Bill Gates for monopoly practices.

</span><span class="item">         Record-breaking sales of FORMULA 1 '97 swerved for an
         unscheduled pit-stop when Formula One Administration Ltd
         (FOA) took cheeky Scouse joyriders Psygnosis to the High
         Court and asked to see their license (specifically, the
         license Psygnosis thought they had from FOA to use F1
         logos, teams, cars, tracks and drivers in the game).
         According to COMPUTER TRADE WEEKLY, FOA dispute this,
         especially since the rights may not be FOA's to sell - many
         teams, drivers and circuits now prefer to do their own
         deals (Jacques Villeneuve wasn't in F197 for this very
         reason). Currently, F197's main problem may be just one
         unauthorised logo; Psygnosis hope to start re-supplying the
         game with just this changed in a week or so. But if your
         copy invites you to go for a spin round "Bronds Hotch" as
         "Damien Hull" or something, now you know why.

         INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON WEARABLE COMPUTERS. Beta test
         cyborgs got to rub enhanced shoulders with Leonard Nimoy,
         author Frederick Pohl and whale pal Sylvia Earle (what were
         they planning - an "unplugged" rendition of Star Trek IV?).
         The usual demos were shown, including Steve Mann's ongoing
         headcam experiment (plus his recent foray into what is best
         described as "underwearables"), and presumably BT's rubbish
         "office on your wrist" mockup. Best paper by far sounds to
         have been "Stochasticks", a "Billiards augmentation system"
         that provides you with a heads-up set of strategic shots in
         the game. As if no-one would notice.

</span><span class="item">         After months of rank staleness, the search engines are
         trying to get their acts together. Altavista announced a
         new 100 million page index, three times larger than before,
         with "virtually no duplicate pages". Wired recently
         revamped Hotbot, and has re-introduced its topical search
         engine Newsbot onto the Web after an ill-fated flirtation
         with an ActiveX-only service. You'd have trouble finding
         much to get excited about there, though: certainly compared
         to AskJeeves, the first "natural language" engine that we
         haven't want to punch in its natural gob. It stomps on
         Newsbot's "intelligent filtering", which last time we
         looked had managed to file a Disney Halloween press release
         under News/Entertainment/Net.Sex.

</span><span class="item">         It's not free local calls - strictly speaking, it's the
         exact opposite - but for most Net users with cable, this is
         just as good. If you get your telephone line from CABLE &amp;
         WIRELESS (that is, if you used to get your line from
         Mercury, NYNEX CableComms, Bell Cablemedia or Videotron
         before they all got sucked up), you can phone any national
         number for any length of time on Saturdays for only 50p. So
         from now until the end of December, you'll be paying only
         2p an hour for a day's permanent Net connection - if you
         can get one. The catch is that your ISP must have at least
         one dial-up line that you can call that *isn't* local to
         you. Check your ISP for details of faraway POPs.

         ADVENTURE. I know what you're thinking: It's an "online
         mystery adventure" produced by a US TV company about a TV
         show we'll never see. It's also image intensive and uses
         Java and Javascript and, you know, we think it might not
         even *exist* via a Lynx text browser. All reasons why we'd

         *everything*, but can even he can get a plug for Wilde into
         the ill-fitting socket of SHOOTING STARS (9.30pm, Fri,
         BBC2)?... this week, Andi Peters' PR-puff piece is called
         STAR WARS, THE MAGIC AND THE MYSTERY (5.20pm, Sat, ITV) -
         apparently to commemorate the special editions' recent
         release on video earlier this month... mad IRA bomber Tommy
         Lee Jones seems chiefly inspired by kids' board game
         Mousetrap in BLOWN AWAY (9pm, Sat, ITV), while ROCKY III
         (11.15pm, Sat, ITV) faces his most terrifying opponent ever
         - Mr T, from The A-Team... Donna MacPhail no longer shouts

         BBC2) is still evil itself; hold out for Lee &amp; Herring's
         triumphant shift to this prestigious slot soon... gun porn
         docu DECISIVE WEAPONS (8pm, Mon, BBC2) was only

         guard!), and resumes with a repeat about the UK's "novelty"
         Harrier jump-jets winning the Falklands... how dull is the
         "revised" EQUINOX (9pm, Mon, C4) about the "world's biggest
         cybercrime"? Let us count the ways... one of the more
         light-hearted X FILES (9.30pm, Wed, BBC1) recounts the
         story of Cancer Man, and may even be a spoof of Dark Skies
         (itself surely just a spoof of The X Files)... the usual
         cliches ("eugenics", "master race", "playing God") pop up
         on the HORIZON (9.25pm, Thu, BBC2) about Dolly the sheep.

         suburban) consists of twentynothings sitting round talking

         a CGI that produces witty epigrams). Still, it does quote
         reviews like "an upfront portrayal of the scribe's gayness"
         (Variety)... sadly, SHOOTING FISH (imdb: romance / comedy)
         isn't a dramatised history of <a href="http://www.suck.com">www.suck.com</a>, but a daft
         kiddie caper whose neatest con is getting any over-5s to go

</span><span class="geekmedia">         SLASH &gt;&gt; Fresh from FrisCon, the private convention for fan
         writers who enjoy the premise of their two favourite male
         TV or movie heroes getting into bed together: The location
         was a smart hotel near San Francisco airport, where staff
         are more used to professional travellers than Professionals
         fans... 90 women checked in plus the cousin of one of the
         con committee and his lover - they went down well, or so it
         was claimed... At the con party, most turned up wearing
         this year's theme of cowboys and indians. Winners were the
         boys, one wearing just a fur skirt and the other a
         transparent cowboy outfit, his modesty hidden beneath a
         very tight pair of cycling shorts - yum, yum... The latest
         slash zines were available in the dealers rooms, and the
         art show revealed recognisable characters in some very
         interesting positions together... The music video comp on
         Sunday had those magic moments set to popular songs... Top
         new slash show this year was US TV cop series The Sentinel,
         although Kirk and Spock, Starsky and Hutch, and Bodie and
         Doyle remain long-time favourites... The con raised over
         $1600 for a local AIDS charity, with my contribution for
         some raffle tickets winning me a set of spurs and handcuffs
         - wonder what I'll do with them?
