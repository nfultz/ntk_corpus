</span><span class="item">         KayCee was an attractive blonde teenage girl from middle
         America, whose daily struggle with leukemia won the hearts
         of many, thanks to her - and her mother's - meticulously
         weblogged thoughts, dreams, and poetry. Last week she sadly
         passed away, and a sizeable chunk of her fellow bloggers
         found themselves grieving a a person who they barely knew,
         but whose short life suddenly meant a great deal to them.
         Even more so, when Debbie, her "mother", confessed that 
         KayCee didn't exist, that she'd written all the blog entries
         herself, and effectively engineered her imaginary daughter's
         own death. Summary to future imaginary people: if you think
         cynics are bad, then you really don't want to piss off the
         open-hearted kindly loving folk who tend to cluster around
         reassuring cute-looking cancer victims they've never met. So
         far, judging by the threads on MetaFilter (which, in a
         sympathy attack, decided to not exist itself this week,
         vanishing off the Net at its most popular point ever) and
         the inevitable KayCee Yahoo! Club, previous fans of the saga
         plan on humiliating Debbie in her home town, and maybe have
         her arrested under mail fraud charges. So: if you want those
         blogging hits, do struggle with leukemia, not some complex,
         ambiguous illness like Munchausen's-By-Proxy. You'll never 
         get the care packages flooding in with *that*.

</span><span class="item">         Not sure how we managed to report this one before Slashdot,
         but the European Parliament report on Echelon is (leaking)
         out all over the place, with the following recommendations
         included: that the Member States "develop and manufacture
         encryption technology and software and above all to support
         projects aimed at developing user-friendly open-source
         encryption software", and "public administrations of the
         member states are called upon systematically to encrypt
         e-mails so that ultimately encryption becomes the norm".
         Looking forward to running the diffs on the final, published
         report.

</span><span class="item">         Our campaign to handicap the NEW MEDIA AGE "Effectiveness" 
         award-winners continues, as LESLIE BUNDER, to the relief of 
         all, reveals that jewish.co.uk *has* been shortlisted as a 
         "Best Portal", and that someone at NMA "made a mistake" when 
         they told him that it wasn't. Anonymous tipsters claimed that 
         Foresight's <a href="http://www.comicrelief.co.uk">www.comicrelief.co.uk</a> has been similarly honoured 
         (category unknown) - but, since the list of nominees was 
         originally suppressed on the grounds that some were so "weak" 
         they would "give away" who the winners were [see last week's 
         NTK], maybe the others are understandably trying to keep it 
         quiet. Clearly this didn't apply to the one award you could 
         view the nominees for: the "person who's contributed most to 
         the industry over the past year", which covers such noted 
         luminaries as Stelios from Easyjet, Mike Lynch from Autonomy, 
         and Jason George from Victoria Real. Oh, why don't they just 
         give it to Douglas Adams for "inventing the internet", and be 
         done with it?

         representative of the UKUUG LINUX DEVELOPERS' CONFERENCE 2001 
         (from 2001-06-29, UMIST, Manchester, UKP30 if you register 
         before 2001-06-01), referring to their somewhat candid images 
         of some of the speakers: Janet cache developer Martin Hamilton 
         ("That's staying until he supplies a real photo"); reality 
         hacker Tom Rathborne ("Is that what too much GIMP does to your 
         eyes?"); and Samba dude Luke Kenneth Casson Leighton (no 
         further questions, your honour). Other upcoming deadlines 
         include the always-entertaining NETMEDIA EUROPEAN ONLINE 
         JOURNALISM AWARDS (closing date 2001-05-31), whose ever-
         expanding categories now include Science, Financial Reporting, 
         Environment, Business &amp; Economics, Music &amp; Entertainment, 
         Sports, Technology and "Outstanding Contribution To Online 
         Journalism In Europe", which even we were shortlisted for last 
         year, so clearly it's anyone's game at this stage...

</span><span class="item">         POE suffers from being "the last really interesting Perl 
         development" (Mark-Jason Dominus) before all this Perl 6
         craziness: it's the little known lad on crutches left behind
         after the Pied Pipers of Sebastopol took everyone else to
         la-la land. That's a damn shame, because hidden behind the
         minimal, babelfish English documentation, and cra-hey-azy
         secret origins (it started off as a MUD engine, but then so
         do most great ideas, yeah?), is a fine event-driven,
         object-oriented environment for Perl. Its time has come.
         Back in 1999, when the living was easy and POE was first
         announced, you didn't need many event-driven object-oriented
         environments to parse 100KB of comma-delimited-files and 
         output a Web form, or whatever your Perl glue did. These
         days: well, POE can wrap itself around a GTK loop and manage
         a fistful of transient, self-contained, self-creating
         objects. Or it can run a Webserver as an foreground
         interface to a bunch of background Perl objects doing God
         knows what. Even NTK's official Perl lamers wrote an HTTP
         SOAP server which simultaneously controlled an IRC bot by
         using POE to splice a bunch of CPAN modules together - in an
         evening. POE is ZOPE without the "Zzzz" of Python. It's
         small enough to understand, and big enough to extend. It 
         *is* worth a weekend of your copious free time.
