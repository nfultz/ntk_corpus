      A. DAVE WINER again - answering, it seems, his own question. The
         expression - which refers to "Dive Into Python" author Mark
         Pilgrim, XML guru Sam Ruby, and, uh, 16 year old kid Aaron
         Swartz, popped up in a piece Dave wrote, attacking Pilgrim
         and others for "stalking" him by automatically tracking
         his continuous and invisible re-writes of his articles.
         A while later, Dave re-edited the piece, deleting the
         phrase. So we guess he didn't say it at all. Our goof.

         Microsoft developer and author of the bestselling book,
