         co-authors BRABEN and BELL moved to "Dangerous" rating this
         week: fugitive Bell, whose previous Web site releases of the
         Elite binaries had been nuked from orbit by Frontier
         wildsman Braben's military-grade laser, has fought back with
         a full source release of the original BBC Micro version: all
         20KB of glorious retro myth. The site's just a pile of
         interplanetary scrap metal now, presumably due to the return
         of Braben's legal Vipers, but not before hundreds of fans
         had snatched the illegal goods, and Ctrl-H'd out into
         untraceable hyperspace. Will Braben turn against his fans?
         Will the rebels of the Reverse-Engineered Elite Source
         Project receive an unexpected fillup? Keep watching the
         monochrome starfield, traders!

         following the posting of hundreds of abusive messages. Delays
         and chaos regarding Ken Livingstone's nomination. Who could
         possibly be organising such a high-tech assault on Her
         Majesty's Government and Opposition? Maybe the new Bond film
         has twisted our perceptions, but we do not deem it unrelated
         that CLIVE SINCLAIR chose this moment to reveal his
         candidature for Mayor of London. Zikes for public transport
         policy; Mensa members placed in all positions of power; and
         a threat to sabotage every nuclear power station running on

</span><span class="item">         Finally: as some of you might have noticed, while the
         Queen's speech killed the weird "guilty until proven
         innocent" clauses in the Electronic Communications (nee
         E-Commerce) Bill, we're expecting them to emerge in the
         Home Office's interception of communications re-think later
         this parliament. Due to an unfortunate tendency on behalf of
         our readers (and ourselves) to interpret anything we say as
         sarcastic, we can't tell you outright what the impact of
         those clauses would be on personal liberty. But that's okay,
         because RMS is far better at this than we'll ever be. We'll
         keep an eye on the legislation if you do too. And if
         we both end up in prison because of it, we'll help with the
         tunnelling too.

</span><span class="item">         When people ask us what our favourite OS is, we like to say
         "we hate them all equally". But sometimes, an amazing
         innovation in computer science occurs which changes, well,
         everything. Announcing NTK's official operating system for
         the new millennium: HARRIXOS. Harrixos is everything we'd
         ever want from a kernel and more: great UI, incredibly
         structured architecture, with future support for DVD, USB,
         Firewire and as the self-effacing author Harris notes, "all
         the kinds of things that make an OS ROCK!". Originally
         designed for the Atari800XL, HARRIXOS would surely have
         smashed Microsoft's monopoly on the OS market years ago,
         were it not for a few inevitable delays in shipping, and
         dare we say it, an element of Redmond-driven sabotage during
         the 3.08 beta trials. But, like OS fanatics everywhere, we
         won't let these petty set-backs defeat us. Ladies and
         gentleman, the most significant pre-announcement you will
         ever see. We give you: HARRIXOS.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; yeah, we'd be interested in seeing Kevin Williamson or
         Michael Bay direct a Bond movie, but unfortunately the 37th in
         the series of "action films for people who don't normally go to
         action films" TOMORROW'S WORLD NEVER SAYS DIE ENOUGH AGAIN
         (imdb: promotional abbreviation - TWINE) merely recycles the
         usual boat chases, ski chases and dreadful walk-ons by British
         character actors, in a thrillingly tortuous storyline involving
         - get this! - an *international oil pipeline*! Still, at least
         Denise "Starship Troopers" Richards dresses up as Lara Croft
         for no readily apparent reason... less plot, more stunts in
         rip-roaringly Gallic comic-book auto pursuit no-brainer TAXI
         (imdb: taxi / car / chase / hold-up / motorcycle / police) -
         apparently not up to Luc Besson's usual standards, but when
         that includes The Fifth Element, god help us all. Oh, and it's
         not particularly closely based around the 1980s Charles/
         Burrows/ Charles sitcom of the same name (they haven't even
         kept the theme tune!)... "Charlize Theron is not even naked in
         it" complains one imdb user of sci-fi yawnathon THE ASTRONAUT'S
         WIFE (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a> : doom violence;
         death after self-inflicted facial injury; fall down stairs by
         pregnant woman; leaving a cab without paying the fare; hateful
         shouting; man giving a woman a bath and flashes of it) -
         imagine an upmarket Johnny Depp "Rosemary's Baby" remake of
         "Species", a film whose only merits lie in its trashy B-movie
         (lack of) aspirations...

         Featuring no Dr Who, but time-travel of a sort in
         "Eastenders 1666" and "Riverdance - Dancing on Dangerous
         Ground" - hopefully some kind of minefield... Satellite
         viewers can take two fistfulls of the controversial
         post-Columbine BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (Fri, 20:00, Sky1)
         season finale "Graduation Day"... Another chance to catch
         "Dune Guy" in TWIN PEAKS: FIRE WALK WITH ME (Sun, 23:20,
         BBC2) which Lynch apparently filmed, frame for frame, in
         reverse order, with the actors delivering their lines in
         reverse phonetics...  if you're asking yourself if the
         basketball being dribbled by Jim Carrey in black-comedy THE
         CABLE GUY (Sun, 22:00, C4) is real or computer generated,
         you've probably missed the film's satirical point about
         television culture - and we don't blame you... "From the
         creator of seaQuest DSV" trumpets the publicity FARSCAPE
         (Mon, 18:20, BBC2): a family-friendly Muppet Lexx-a-like...
         An evening of malformed URLS is promised by C5's INTERNET
         NIGHT wherein the mysterious chaotic forces of scheduling
         have managed to clash "The Fugitive - but with a PowerBook"
         movie spin-off THE NET (Wed, 21:00, C5) with "IRL" cases of
         women harrassed on the net in 21ST CENTURY STALKING (Wed,
         22:15, BBC1). Later, C5 offers its own perspective on the
         issue of WOMEN ON THE WEB, (Web, 23:20, C5) - profiling the
         girls who strip for webcams...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         GOOFLET&gt;&gt; A little birdie (and some further research in the
         ICANN minutes) showed that NSI wanted to keep the old whois
         format, despite our claims last week, but were overruled by
         the other registrars. And they've set up an Old Skool whois
         at whois.networksolutions.com to help folk with broken
         scripts. NTK regrets the slur. Not much, because it's NSI.
         But a bit.
