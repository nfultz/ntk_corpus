</span><span class="item">         No lunch, but plenty of Guinness: the perfect recipe for
         Bram Cohen's CODECON 2002 at the DNA Lounge last weekend. 
         Jamie Zawinski was the host, paid it seems in constant robust
         on-stage Mozilla-dissings. But jwz chose to hold court only
         in the shadowy infra-conference taking place on IRC between
         802.11b-wielding audience members. Onstage activity was left
         to a) handsome shoe-gazing hackers describing potentially
         copyright-infringing ecosystems written while on the dole,
         b) older attorneys grimfacedly pleading with them to never
         openly mention any illicit activities, and c) grinning
         ancient heroes irresponsibly gloating over past criminal
         capers. In the first camp, Dan "effugas" Kaminsky's "batshit
         things I've done with ssh to beat NAT" talk and Jonathan
         Moore's self-organising, self-routing, self-aware port of
         military-industrial Wifi tech MobileMesh scored the highest
         cred points. In the second category, Fred von Lohrmann's
         repeated attempts to prevent Peer To Peer To Prison
         scenarios - including an overly cheery suggestion to have
         your back-of-an-envelope network diagrams edited by legal
         counsel - were soberly heeded. (He made some very good
         points on avoiding live updates and freeloader-punishing,
         too: lest the court make you update a network-killer, or
         force you to punish *all* your users equally). Finally, in
         the unrepentant good old boys' camp: one day you'll be as
         old as Phil Zimmermann, who finally announced that he *did*
         upload the PGP source to a world-readable location, or Eric
         Hughes, who revealed it was he who posted the proprietary
         RC4 encryption sourcecode to sci.crypt. But until you can
         count the years and do the Statute of Limitations
         calculation: keep schtum, and keep coding.

</span><span class="item">         Codecon's legal panel was a bit riling for the dirty
         foreigners in the audience. The DMCA might be bad, they
         reassured the audience, but some other countries' laws were
         plain awful. "I heard the UK's law is very bad", said one
         panelist, the unspoken "IANAL" hanging over his words. Well
         - as one of the sources who publicised Britain's old-style
         DMCA law - it's *bad*, as they say, but it's not *criminal*.
         While the US feds can come and practically arrest you for
         telling a friend how to change the region code on your DVD
         player, a company still has to file a civil suit here in the 
         UK. Of course, such namby-pambiness won't last for long.
         Article 8(3) of the EUCD (to be part of British law by the
         end of this year) will ensure that ISPs share liability for
         allegedly copyright-infringing material. So even if your ISP
         knows it's dumb to block Napster, or that your satire site is
         free speech, they won't be able to risk getting done over by
         the intellectual property barons. Who needs the police when
         the Internet is "self-policing"? Also, it's goodbye to "fair
         use": while the EUCD says that countries can include
         exemptions for current practice, rumour has it that the UK
         won't bother with uncrippled media for the disabled, archive
         preservation or personal backups. The EUCD is bad in theory,
         and could be much worse in implementation. Drag yourself to
         Cambridge tomorrow to discuss how to fix it.

         compare it to the daily re-inventions of the live Web.

         devised "Mornington Crescent" as an example of an activity

</span><span class="item">         SPAMASSASSIN sits between you and your inbox, picking over
         your mail and weighting it against over two hundred spam
         indicators, like multiple exclamation marks, the phrase
         "Trace anyone by social security number", and "This is not
         spam". Mails that trip one too many sensors get tagged with
         an indicator in the subject line and a detailed
         justification for their punishment in the body. They can be
         automatically bounced back to source, sent off to /dev/null
         or reported to the authorities. If Spamassasin's barrel of
         ingenious regexp tests wasn't enough, the author, official
         NTK hero Justin Mason, has assimilated wider checks (Vipul's
         razor, various blackhole databases) into the program, and
         uses a genetic algorithm to regularly re-weigh the settings
         - leading to a really very impressive hit rate. Out of
         around 130 messages (or 677KB) of spam a day, v1.0
         spamassassin let through only a handful of bad boys, and
         imprisoned less than one legitimate mail a day. And Version
         2.0's new auto-whitelist means that now even your most
         spam-akin friends need only stop SHOUTING!!! for one posting
         to be permanently allowed past. There's a standalone
         assassin daemon for ISPs, and a great deal of contributed
         activity with the prog. In the long run, we guess it may
         just make the spammers smarter, but, hell, we'd be happy
         with even that small evolutionary step. If you haven't got
         it, take a look. And if you have - how did we score?

         soundalikes this month, with PAUL TAYLOR leading the pack for
         not only identifying that the chorus of A1's "Caught In The
         Middle" is "a blatant rip-off" of Natalie Imbruglia's "Torn",
         but that you can replicate it yourself by feeding "Torn"
         through the "Female-To-Male" EAX effect on Creative Labs
         soundcards. Regarding Samantha Mumba's "Baby Been Thinking
         Bout You Lately", and The Stone Roses' "Made Of Stone" ("When
         the streets are cold and lonely/ And the cars they burn below
         me") - "It's the same song innit!", argued ANONYMOUS TIPSTER,
         though RONAN WAIDE ventured into yet more obscure territory by
         alleging that Stillwater's "Fever Dog" (from the soundtrack to
         "Almost Famous") "carries the same drumbeat" as U2's "Bullet
         The Blue Sky" while "the guitar is only lacking the steel
         slide bits at the end of each power chord"... "Perhaps Jesus
         Jones are supporting me at SXSW?" piped up TOBY SLATER,
         referring to an earlier version of the festival line-up
         <a href="http://www.sxsw.com/music/0festival/bands/">http://www.sxsw.com/music/0festival/bands/</a> linked to from NTK
         2002-02-08. "Or maybe I'm supporting them?", Toby continues,
         "Maybe we can get The Soup Dragons and Candy Flip along as
         well". Or maybe it might help explain the preponderance of
         American brands in your jaunty would-be anticapitalist anthem,
         "Consumption", Toby: <a href="http://www.tobyslater.com/consumption/">http://www.tobyslater.com/consumption/</a> -
         no wonder you "keep on buying so much [you] don't need" if
         you're buying it from Pacific Bell, whose core business is
         providing local telecommuncations services for the West Coast
         of the USA... and finally, following NTK 2002-02-08's Buffy-
         inspired suggestion that the stammering Pop Idol guy should
         "just sing everything he says", ALAN CONNOR sympathetically
         weighed in with a list of cover versions he could do - Paul
         Hardcastle's "19", for instance - if he wanted to pursue a
         separate career as "MC Stammer", with further possibilities at:

         But it was left to LLOYD WOOD to sneer Simon Cowell-style at
         the whole idea, pointing out that "stammering results from
         paying too much attention to what you say [...] whereas
         singing is overlearned, rehearsed, speech". Lloyd claims he's
         "pretty sure New Scientist covered this recently" - presumably
         as part of their "The Science Of Pop Idol" pullout special?...
