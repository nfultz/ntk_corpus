</span><span class="item">         Our Java skills must be getting rusty - we missed out a
         cycle of European Parliament procedure in last week's
         pseudocode summary of the Software Patents process.
         Following the Council of Ministers vote this week, the
         patent proposals now go back to the Parliament for a
         second reading. Any amendments to fix the mess will need an 
         absolute majority there. That's not inconceivable - many of 
         the original EU parliament amendments got over 50% of the
         votes. But it'll be close. But then, it was close all along.
         The Council of Ministers vote was only seven votes short of
         going our way, after lobbying by RMS and others swayed the
         juries of Poland and Spain. Even now, moves are afoot in the
         Dutch parliament to have that country's Council of Ministers
         pro-patent vote retrospectively changed. Lobbying is really
         working: your MEP may be the next to switch.

         putting "NTK" in the subject line if you're mailing us, here's 
         something slightly more ambitious we'd really like for our 
         birthday. With all the RSS/ iCal stuff available now, can't 
         someone, somehow, aggregate together as many tech-related UK 
         events as is feasible in some sort of openly searchable way? 
         Get in touch (don't forget that "NTK" in the subject line...) 
         if you know of one, or are building one, or are convinced 
         "it'd never work, for these patently obvious reasons" - and 
         ultimately we'd replay the favour by regularly linking to the 
         one that's a) friendliest about exporting its data to other 
         websites or services, and b) - at least as importantly - is 
         piss-easy to submit things to.

         accurate portable rendering of what you'd see right now if
         it wasn't pissing down with rain. You'll need a net

         Germany. Free registration for the server; endearingly empty

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; here's hoping the implausibly self-mythologising HOW 
         "FRIENDS" CHANGED THE WORLD (9pm, Sat, C4) examines the theory 
         that the whole show is basically just a dumbed-down version of 
         "Seinfeld", monstrous parents and all... daft made-for-TV 
         nukes-vs-earthquake two-parter 10.5 (7.15pm, Sat, C4) appears 
         to be running as a handy spoiler for C5's "Survival Sunday", 
         of which Michael Bay's character-actor-fest ARMAGEDDON (8pm, 
         Sun, C5) is the arguable highlight... though fortunately you 
         can skip the dodgy ending to see Billy Bob Thornton reappear 
         in offbeat air-traffic control romantic rival comedy PUSHING 
         TIN (10.35pm, Sun, BBC1)... there's more non-verbal nonsense 
         in BODY TALK: SEX (8pm, Mon, C4)... a no-holds-barred look at 
         domain-ownership disputes is promised in THE SEX.COM STORY 
         (11.20pm, Mon, C5)... and Wednesday night is Space Night on 
         C5, in the form of the - stretching the literal definition of 
         "Escape"? - ESCAPE FROM APOLLO 13 (7.30pm, Wed, C5), THE 
         BRITISH UFO FILE (8pm, Wed, C5), plus "Did it blow up the 
         space shuttle?" docu MEGALIGHTNING: STRANGER THAN FICTION 
         (9pm, Wed, C5)... 
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; it's "Gladiator" meets "The Return Of The King" - and 
         not in a good way - in interminable Wolfgang Petersen air-sea 
         trademark TROY ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/troy.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/troy.htm</a> : 
         deceit leading to hundreds of deaths; perverted gloating with 
         victim's body; much talk of servitude to and faith in false 
         gods; a man exposing his full nudity to a woman; man and woman 
         in bed together, repeatedly)... so not a very wide release for 
         the curios smuggled out in its giant blockbuster-shaped shadow, 
         including the semi-autobiographical quirky-even-by-Almodovar-
         standards Spanish religious abuse BAD EDUCATION (imdb: 
         education/ school)... plus "Wayne's World" meets "This Is 
         Spinal Tap" - albeit with most of the jokes taken out - in 
         low-budget Canadian headbanger buddie-movie mockumentary FUBAR 
         ( <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0302585/trivia">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0302585/trivia</a> : The word "fuck" 
         is said 274 times)... 
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         AVAILABLE IN A WIDE RANGE OF BLACK&gt;&gt; yes, this is a bit slack 
         by even our extraordinary standards, but we finally got round 
         to printing one of the very first t-shirt design entries we 
         ever received - the "You Have *No* Idea" slogan, one of many 
         submitted by GORILLA SALAD certainly not much more than 3 and 
         a half years ago: <a href="http://tv.cream.org/gorilla/ntkt/">http://tv.cream.org/gorilla/ntkt/</a> . They/it 
         receive the standard UKP2 for each shirt sold, assuming they 
         come up with a more acceptable method of payment than "Post 
         the coins through Christopher Ecclestone's letterbox", or 
         simply "Put it on a horse!". Also at <a href="http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/">http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/</a> 
         this month: a very simple "Loading..." disclaimer designed by 
         the minimalists over at PC EXTREME magazine, and possibly the 
         last of the "Hey Hey 16K" design recently popularised by the 
         cult b3ta animation <a href="http://www2.b3ta.com/heyhey16k/">http://www2.b3ta.com/heyhey16k/</a> , the 
         success of which apparently prompted "++Ungood;" designer 
         LLOYD WOOD to start composing his own Orwellian promo song (to 
         the same tune): "We'd like to help you with your thoughtcrime/ 
         We'd like to help you with your thoughtcrime/ Double-plus-
         ungood - hey!/ What is 2+2 today?" - and so forth... still, 
         our extremely high aesthetic standards have not deterred the 
         rest of you from continuing to send in entries, from MATTHEW 
         PETTY's <a href="http://www.petty.me.uk/images/paunch_tshirt.png">http://www.petty.me.uk/images/paunch_tshirt.png</a> to an 
         entire wardrobe suggested by MAT SIMPSON - highlights of which 
         include <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/matsimpson/.Pictures/ntk2.jpg">http://homepage.mac.com/matsimpson/.Pictures/ntk2.jpg</a> 
         and <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/matsimpson/.Pictures/ntk4.jpg">http://homepage.mac.com/matsimpson/.Pictures/ntk4.jpg</a> . 
         And text-only submissions need be no barrier to obscurity, as 
         perhaps illustrated by JASMINE STRONG's "Emmanuel Goatse" idea 
         (with "We have always been at war with Eastasia" on the back, 
         "for preference"), plus BOB JORDAN's self-referential "Just 
         one of the many things I have bought off the internet while 
         drunk" - a slogan he came up with on after, you've guessed it, 
         buying a shirt off our website. While drunk. Obviously...
