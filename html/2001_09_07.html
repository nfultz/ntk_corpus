</span><span class="item">         Many have tried to define the "je ne sais quoi" which THE
         REGISTER brings to IT journalism, but their Washington
         correspondent, Thomas C Greene, hit the nail on the head this
         week in his combined mission statement and scathing riposte to
         world-renowned theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. It is
         "irrational insight", Thomas explains, which will always give
         humans the edge over so-called "thinking machines" - leading
         one cynical reader to comment "Lucky we've got The Register
         staff on the front line then". Maybe it's our fuddy-duddy
         Enlightenment ways, but Thomas' subsequent explanation of why
         superintelligent computers could never take over the world
         does seem to require some "mysterious and unreliable gifts" to
         fully comprehend it, dragging out the old anti-strong-AI
         argument that DNA evolution (or quantum consciousness, or
         whatever) is somehow non-deterministic, and that a mere
         computing device could never achieve "religious awareness,
         dance, language, visual arts and literature" - which, of
         course, were so instrumental to the rise of the robots in "The
         Terminator" films. Greene did slip in a surprise treat for
         anyone making it to the end of his second piece, however,
         concluding that if Hawking "actually believes" that humans
         should be genetically engineered to see off the AI menace,
         "then the little shit deserves to be hanged".

</span><span class="item">         Side-effect of being the last-century-but-one's top
         imperialist: no matter how confused and corrupt your own
         institutions become, the suckers upon which you dumped
         half-arsed variants always get it worse. AUSTRALIA's many
         and varied libel laws, for instance, are generally taken to
         be as bad, if not worse, than Britain's. And now everyone
         gets to share in their mediocrity: the Supreme Court of
         Victoria decided last week that a Website published in New
         Jersey, USA, can be sued for libel in Victoria, Australia if
         someone even blinks at their Website while down under. In
         the short term, this means that Joe Gutnick, current
         plaintiff, gold-miner and noted Aussie rule football fan,
         gets to sue US company Dow Jones in an environment much more
         friendly to suers than suees. And in the long term Australia
         will join Britain as the cyberlibel haven of repetitive
         litigants, and you'll all be dragged down to our level of
         muted politeness.

         just waving or otherwise reacting to your neighbourhood
         telescreen could help make the point, and might even distract
         a jaded operator from an actual crime taking place on a
         different monitor. The activism continues on Mon with the
         second TECH 2 (from 2001-09-10, various venues, Leeds) - a
         more technically competent version of the "Tech Nicks"
         conference which kept us so amused last summer, and the
         apparently media-ignored protests against DSEi, the DEFENCE
         SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT INTERNATIONAL exhibition at London
         Docklands (Tue 2001-09-11) - who, let's hope, won't be
         spoiling for a chance to try out their new non-lethal
         "civilian pacification" technologies. All of which is kind of
         academic, of course, because 02:46am Sunday 2001-09-09 UK
         local time marks the passing of Unix's one billionth epoch
         second - and probable apocalypse, now everyone thinks the
         media and IT industry were just crying wolf about Y2K last
         time. The EFF, bless 'em, are holding a copyright-free concert
         in San Francisco just beforehand, so your last conscious act
         on this earth need not be one of despicable commodification of
         cultural property that really belongs in the public domain.

         to our readers' everyday lives? By the expedient, mon brave,
         of *never having any friends*. On the other hand, we do have
         a long list of people we have unjustly wronged, and it is to
         these we must make futile pandering gestures from time to
         time. Heading that list was always MOOSE INDUSTRIES 2000,
         whose excellent Tellytubbies site we once wiped off the face
         of the Earth, and whose FUCK LINUX t-shirts we inconceivably
         declined to retail. The site remains mirrored, the T-shirts
         stay on Cafe Press; but still the slate is not clean. Small
         Rocket's STAR MONKEY is a shareware 2D shoot 'em up for
         Windows, like old skool Bitmap Brothers if they'd had access
         to 3D accelerators instead of Amigas. It is good - even if
         the demo is a bit short to tell whether it's worth $15 or
         not. Moose coded it.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CONFECTIONERY THEORY&gt;&gt; NESTLE are spending UKP2.5m to promote
         the mildly underwhelming AERO HONEYCOMB (32p), but you simply
         don't care - our mailbag has been metaphorically crackling
         with reactions to SNICKERS CRUNCHER (from 25p), perhaps best
         described by MATT MULLEN as "packed with whatever Mars might
         be overstocked with - 'Crisped Rice, Crunchy Peanuts, Caramel
         &amp; Milk Chocolate' - crammed in such a way as to remind me of
         the old cellophane-wrapped 'Nutty' bar. Not recommended
         straight from the fridge for anybody with human jaws, OK if
         you are some sort of jackal or wild dog of similar capacity".
         "Like eating a Toffee Crisp that's had nuts bunged in it",
         agreed DANIEL THORNTON, while MATT LOCKE eulogised: "the light
         airy rice of a Toffee Crisp, the crunchy peanuts of the
         Snicker, but no gooey caramel that sticks in your teeth and
         makes you feel guilty about not flossing. Lovely". Dissent was
         limited to old-fashioned TOM "Wasn't nougat the whole point of
         Marathons?" BLAKESON and PAUL MISON, who noted "it's only 40g,
         or two Mars Quarks, compared to 65g for a Mars Bar these days"
         - in fact retailers have been told to position it away from
         its full-fat Snickers sibling, to make it "more appealing to
         women"... a more muted response to MARS' LIMITED EDITION MINT
         TWIX (27p) - "the same sort of mintiness as a Viscount bar,
         with the added benefit of toffee. The chocolate-flavoured
         biscuit was a pleasant surprise" (ADAM JEFFERSON); "a
         wonderful combination of After Eight mints, with a Twix, with
         all the creamy sweetness of cheap English chocolate" (OWEN
         BLACKER) - and those "HARRY POTTER" BERTIE BOTTS EVERY FLAVOUR
         BEANS [as seen in NTK 2001-08-10], spotted by ADAM GOLDING
         while on holiday in the US, and described by him as "bad -
         particularly horseradish flavour which is vile. The sardine
         flavour is also not unlike lung scrapings", adding that there
         are 5 other novelty yucky flavours "too disgusting to
         describe". HARIBO are believed to be launching an unbranded
         "me too" bag of MAGIC MIX (99p), while DANIEL THORNTON (again)
         deadpanned that "MONSTER MUNCH now turn your mouth blue
         apparently. God knows why it's a selling point though"... ALEX
         TEA - if only his parents had named him "Rich" - confirmed the
         "All Your Base" inspiration of the OINGY BOINGY ads, which
         were "creative directed" by his "girlfriend's dad"; ADRIAN
         MOULDER praised the "increased structural integrity" of the
         MCDONALDS MCCHICKEN WRAP ("Tasty chicken, chargrilled peppers
         &amp; onions, lime salsa, tortilla, cool sour cream &amp; chive
         sauce"), compared to "the self-destructing BURGER KING ones";
         but CRAIG STEPHENS filed the biggest report of the month,
         detailing the recent range of Formula 1-themed one-week-only
         sandwiches inflicted by "Mucky D's" on Germany, including the
         MCFRANCE ("a rather insipid cordon-bleu type affair permeated
         by a garlic sauce with a fetid aftertaste"), the MCMALAYSIA
         ("a chapati containing salad and some actually rather pleasant
         'oriental' sauce"), and the MCBRITAIN ("an odd rehash of the
         singularly unpopular curry Chicken McFu"). And you don't want
         to know about the MCGERMANY ("exactly the same as the
         McFarmer, only with mustard") and the vegetarian MCEUROPE - we
         should all be grateful that <a href="http://www.mcstories.com/">http://www.mcstories.com/</a> remains
