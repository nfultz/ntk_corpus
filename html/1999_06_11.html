</span><span class="item">         In a post-Net Strike parliamentary debate on unmetered
         telecoms, Ian Bruce MP rather smugly declared that certain
         telecommunications companies had confided in his very
         important ear that they were going to go unmetered in a
         matter of weeks. Who could he mean? Well, fortunately we've
         been in the position of having somebody swear us to secrecy
         about this every twelve minutes for the last fortnight. And,
         on the assumption that once an MP realises something, it
         must be inches away from blindingly obvious, we might as well
         blab. So, big secret: it's BT, it's ADSL, it's coming in
         September, it's unmetered, it's always on and it'll cost
         c.30UKP a month. More predictions: they won't have enough
         installers so you'll have to wait ages, journalists will
         write scary articles about "portscanners", even more
         pisspoor TV people will enter the industry hoping to present
         "high-bandwidth video documentaries" online, the newsgroups
         will fill with people whinging that they only get 300Kb/s
         and want their money back. But none of us will care,
         because, you who want this *so* badly and have prayed for
         so long, you will be happy.

</span><span class="item">         "ISP casualties 'inevitable'", declared the BBC News site
         this week, as another zillion free ISPs sprang out of the
         telco woodwork, each adorned in its own freakish
         Cambrian-explosion branding. Up popped Dellnet, FreeWeb,
         TheMutual, ICLNet - and of course, "FreeBeeb", the BBC's own
         cloying entry into the market. FREEBEEB is a co-venture by
         Scottish "Demon" Telecom and BBC Worldwide. BBC Worldwide 
         is the bit of the BBC that's allowed to be commercial and
         money-grubbing, in order to make money for the rest. Not
         too much money, though: it was they who killed fledgling
         ISP the BBC Networking Club back in December 1995. Why?
         Because, they said, it was clear there was no money in the
         ISP business.

</span><span class="item">         Windows users faced a brand new threat this week, as a new
         virus spread from machine to machine, claiming to be the
         e-mail answer to a question nobody asked. But enough about
         OFFICE 2000 - how's about that worm? Well, we're sure
         everyone affected by the EXPLOREZIP trojan will extend their
         sympathies to those hit hardest - MICROSOFT UK, where the MD
         had his drive trashed as well as dozens of others at Reading
         HQ. In Microsoft's defence, the trojan does not exploit any
         security weakness in Windows: only users naive enough to
         click on a mailed executable are zapped. Guess that learned
         them.

</span><span class="item">         Hey, if George Lucas doesn't want the world to pirate his
         STAR WARS films, why's he keep putting that
         camcorder-calibrating eyetest-chart at the beginning?
         Research suggests that the 1.3 gig VCD Phantom Menace
         currently circulating isn't full digital-to-digital
         "zero-day" warez, but in fact a (fairly good)
         cinema-camcorder job; near-identical to the knock-off copies
         shifting at your local street market for a fiver. Hallmarks
         include sudden improvement in sound quality at 0:30 mins;
         intermittent audio drop-out (mike clipping?) during pod race
         (1:00); and a "floating Z" at the edge of the screen. VCD
         has minor MPEG artefacts, some VHS versions have Chinese
         subtitles - handy for the ethnically stereotyped Trade
         Federation - and we don't hold out too much hope for the 800
         meg AVI. Still, with all that CGI and dodgy eyelines, maybe
         the lower the resolution, the better.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; an over-done double helping of FRASIER (10pm, Fri, C4)
         ... a rerun of oddly similar variations on "Alan
         Partridge" geekdom, in COOGAN'S RUN (10pm, Fri, BBC2)...
         plus PERVERSIONS OF SCIENCE? (9.30pm, Fri, Sci-Fi) -
         Perversions Of *Shatner*, more like, as Bill directs and
         guest-stars in the first of a brief bunch of tackily
         "erotic" space stories... a semi-cute cast almost pull
         nooveau-pulp THE ROCKETEER (2.45pm, Sat, ITV) out of its
         nosedive... Coogan's back, plus Lee And Herring, plus -
         uh-oh - the cast of "Big Train" - trying to pay off the
         Third World's overdraft on COMIC RELIEF: THE DEBT WISH SHOW
         (10.40pm, Sat, BBC1)... and Angus Deayton retaliates for
         ITV nicking his "Before They Were Famous" format by stealing
         their Oscar out-takes idea with NOT ANOTHER AWARDS SHOW
         (9.45pm, Sat, BBC1)... something of a theme-night on ITV,
         with Michael Barrymore reporting that ANIMALS DO THE
         FUNNIEST THINGS (6.50pm, Sat, ITV)... spreading lethal
         monkey germs, for instance, as documented later by OUTBREAK
         (9pm, Sat, ITV)... while inbetween, primates parade
         elaborate mating displays in MAN O MAN (7.50pm, Sat, ITV) -
         of course, they should do a more authentic, fighting-based
         show and call it "MANO A MANO"... it's the last of this
         series of THIS MORNING WITH RICHARD NOT JUDY (12.15pm, Sun,
         BBC2)... the clear inspiration for the Star Wars "trench"
         bit at the end of 633 SQUADRON (3pm, Sun, ITV)... and, again
         on satellite, we're hoping that the spin-off series of THE
         NET (10pm, Sun, Sci-Fi) sees the Sandra Bullock character
         having a different aspect of her identity erased each week,
         with hilarious consequences... C5's sensationalist
         barrel-scraping hits inevitable paranormal hokum STRANGER
         THAN FICTION (8pm, Mon, C5), then, yet more imaginatively,
         hospital docusoap A &amp; E (8pm, Tue, C5)... the "Scared To
         Death" season aptly continues with BODY DOUBLE (10pm, Mon,
         C4), an erotic thriller - with Melanie Griffith! Aiieeee!
         ... and chubby DJ Carl Cox presides over no-doubt
         vastly embarrassing dance music show ACETATE (11.15pm, Mon,
         BBC2)... following "Holding The Baby", Sally Phillips'
         <a href="http://www.w2s.net/sally-phillips/">http://www.w2s.net/sally-phillips/</a> sitcom choices haven't 
         improved, as she guests in KISS ME KATE (8.30pm, Tue,
         BBC1)... and a brief spate of new shows on Thu, with
         cookie-cutter Roddenberry alien nonsense EARTH: FINAL
         CONFLICT (8.05pm, Thu, C5), Ben Miller/ Dennis Pennis
         theatrecom COMING SOON (10.30pm, Thu, ITV), wacky barrister
         style show SLAVE (11.30pm, Thu, C4) - and, most puzzlingly
         of all, the new series of OZ (12midnight, Thu, C4),
         inexplicably described by Radio Times as a "Sci-fi prison
         drama"...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; yes, it stars a hacker, and it's kind of about VR,
         but get over it: Keanu Reeves' thermodynamics-defying
         talk-heavy effects-lite trenchcoat shoot-em-up THE MATRIX
         (imdb: alternate-earth / cyberspace / shootout / martial-
         arts / slow-motion / training / artificial- intelligence / 
         computers / cyberpunk / men-in-black) takes the best bits 
         of The Terminator, Total Recall, and They Live and pisses 
         them up the wall - to the accompaniment of the soundtrack 
         from Spawn and, in one pivotal action scene, shameful Brit 
         techno-novelty act The Propellerheads... still, you're 
         probably going to ignore us and go see it anyway, considering 
         what it's up against: long-unawaited offbeat nomadic Pete 
         Postlethwaite pylon-painting love story AMONG GIANTS 
         (imdb: romance)... re-released elderly Michael Caine caper 
         GET CARTER (imdb: thriller) - from the director of "Flash 
         Gordon" and "Morons From Outer Space"... or Jimmy "Cracker" 
         McGovern's typically upbeat domestic violence transplant 
         horror HEART (imdb: UK) - not particularly based around the 
         1988 Pet Shop Boys song - or the Seattle '80s girl-rock band 
         - of the same name ( you know, the ones who had a hit with
         <a href="http://stat.tamu.edu/~sherman/KEOS/lyrics/sartre.html">http://stat.tamu.edu/~sherman/KEOS/lyrics/sartre.html</a> )...

         yes, even we couldn't be bothered to get into the online price-
         slashing for HANNIBAL (RRP 16.99 - yeah, right, Amazon 8.33),
         when branches of WH Smiths were serving it up for just
         UKP9.99... probably our closest to a half-price bestseller was
         latest cyber-romance nonsense SINGLE WHITE EMAIL (RRP 6.99,
         Amazon 5.59) - written by an Australian, which doesn't really
         explain why it's not nearly as bad as all the dire previous
         efforts in this ever-expanding genre... this month's token
         goatee-stroker is Steve Beard's inappropriately named
         "transmissions from the edge of style culture" compilation
         LOGIC BOMB (RRP 10.00, Amazon 8.00), which nonetheless has one
         of the good, early UK "otaku" articles - from a 1991 i-D...
         fighting it out in London's remainder bins are Mark Leyner's
         MY DREAM DATE WITH DI (RRP 6.99, Amazon 5.59, now 2.99), David
         Foster Wallace's INFINITE JEST (RRP 9.99, Amazon 7.99, now
         4.99), and - pick of the bunch - Nicholson "Vox" Baker's
         hardback THE SIZE OF THOUGHTS (RRP 7.99, Amazon 6.39, now
         4.99); hyper-focussed musings on model aircraft, card
         catalogues, and, on p232, the funniest ever "CD-ROM reviewed
         by trying to play it in a CD player"... but our "literally
         unputdownable" recommendation goes - no, not to Terry
         Pratchett's THE SCIENCE OF DISCWORLD (RRP 14.99, Amazon 8.99)
         - but to the "authors inbetween" who've said "Let's all meet
         up" in CTHULHU 2000 (RRP $12.95, Amazon 7.27); Bruce Sterling,
         Kim Newman, Harlan Ellison etc pay largely effective 
         contemporary tribute to HP Lovecraft's mythos, which, as
         Jarvis Cocker feared, is indeed "strange" when they're all
         "fully grown"... we close with NTK's resident Matrix apologist
         pointing fans toward Neil Gaiman's spin-off story at
         <a href="http://www.whatisthematrix.com/cmp/neil_g.html">http://www.whatisthematrix.com/cmp/neil_g.html</a> ... and our
         admission that we haven't checked whether Neal Stephenson's
         glaring attribution of Cap'n Crunch to General Mills from
         "Disco 2000" <a href="http://www.scs.carleton.ca/~morin/misc/capn/">http://www.scs.carleton.ca/~morin/misc/capn/</a> then
         made it into the final draft of CRYPTONOMICON (RRP 12.99,
         Amazon not in UK stock), when in fact Cap'n Crunch is, of
         course, made by Quaker Oats. (Hey, Stephenson, crypto,
         nitpicking and breakfast cereal - how could we resist?)...
