         lawyer shrapnel this week, but sensing that they had the
         will of the people (and an army of slashdot anonymous
         cowards) on their side, continued to release betas of their
         snazzy MP3 distribution system. In preparation for the
         inevitable next step, free source implementations of the
         client appeared for Linux - and strong rumours of a Perl
         server waiting in the wings, should the Napsters get kill
         -9ed by the music industry police. Do you think we should
         tell them about Hotline next?

         consumer action problems is, short of doorstepping Tim
         Berners-Lee and Vint Cerf, there's nobody obvious to *nab*.
         Naturally, that doesn't stop our protectors having a go.
         Facting us until we fart next week are Sue Lawley and her
         CRIME SQUAD, who have been exposing hacking and software
         piracy online where'er they find it. And if they don't find
         it - what then? That's the question that some Web companies
         have been asking after they were contacted by the program,
         and asked to "hack their own servers to show how it's done".
         When, naturally, they declined, the programme makers hinted
         that they really should, because otherwise the squad and
         their new mates would do it anyway. And to whom are we
         supposed to complain about that? Also making the Net safer
         for the rest of us next week, an upcoming "Here And Now"
         looks into Web fraud. At least they had the decency to
         invent a *funny* fake threat:

</span><span class="item">         After the war, the decommissioning. NSI have begun working
         out the conditions of their pax with ICANN, including this
         week, the announcement that they'd be redirecting the
         rs.internic.net whois server to the registry whois at
         whois.nsiregistry.net. So from December whois *won't* tell
         you who owns the domain, but instead refer you someone else
         who should know who owns the domain. Sound confusing? Well,
         just wait until automatic domain lookup programs
         start breaking on 1999-12-01 - then you'll have confusion by
         the lorry-load. The format to the new whois is completely
         different to the old service, even though it should have
         been possible for NSI to set up a backwards compatible,
         cross-registry whois (a la <a href="http://www.geektools.com">www.geektools.com</a>) with just a
         little more coding. There could have been good tech reasons
         for not doing that, but we'll never know, because NSI knows
         best. Even, we note, when it comes to leaking out personal
         info on their prospective shareholders...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV (AND RADIO)&gt;&gt; Yes, the reason we're a bit early this week
         is to give you a chance in hell of catching Bill Gibson's
         favourite Velvet Underground MP3s in DESERT ISLAND DISCS
         (Fri, 09:00, Radio 4)... we warned SO GRAHAM NORTON (Fri,
         22:30, C4) last series; if they try faking any more
         hilarious "website phonecalls", we will *have them*... and
         for some reason TV stations don't want anyone watching on
         Saturday night, which is why they're givng us Bruce Willis
         vanity project HUDSON HAWK (Sat, 00:40, ITV), Joe Dante's
         PIRANHA (Sat, 23:25, C4), Bob Geldof and Mel Smith in NUMBER
         ONE (Sat, 00:25, C5), and worthy extended Bosnia APC product
         placement army drama WARRIORS (Sat, 21:00, BBC1) - not to be
         confused with the 1979 gang movie of the same name... still,
         Satellite viewers can tussle with SKYROCKET (Sat, 18:00,
         Sky1) some kind of webcast thing featuring The Simpsons/
         KotH/ Futurama/ Family Guy/ PJs, and known NTK subscriber,
         Ben Moor (crap site at <a href="http://www.skyrocket.co.uk/">http://www.skyrocket.co.uk/</a> )... then
         console themselves with season 3 of SOUTH PARK (Sun, 23:00,
         Sky1), featuring Jennifer Annistonandon... Hugh Grant/ Gene
         Hackman medico-thriller EXTREME MEASURES (Sun, 22:00, C4)
         comes on like a comatose "Coma"... while the ever-impartial
         BBC balances its current "Webwise" campaign with no less
         than *three* po-faced investigations into "cyber-crime": THE
         MONEY PROGRAMME (Sun, 22:30, BBC2), Kuji-featuring THE CRIME
         SQUAD (19:30, Mon, BBC1) [see news], Julia Sawalahalaha's
         guide to 21ST CENTURY STALKING (Wed 12/01, 22:15, BBC1) plus
         - the inevitable - TERMINATOR 2: JUDGMENT DAY (Wed, 22:20,
         BBC1)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; at last! *another* heavy-handed fly-on-the-wall
         satire: ED TV (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a> : noted
         lesbian actress as a central figure; vulgar hand gesture,
         manipulation of human anatomy, and body gesture; a sexual
         T-shirt; homosexual presence). Ellen DeGeneres, Rob Reiner
         televise the daily activities (though sadly no real-life
         drug-bust antics) of Matthew McConaughey to an audience of
         confused FHM readers who inexplicably prefer Liz Hurley over
         Jenna "Dharma And Greg" Elfman... clearly having learned
         nothing from the ridiculous current ad campaign for Disney's
         "moo-LARN", couldn't supposedly brainy Ralph Fiennes and
         writer Michael Ignatieff have come up with a pronounceable
         title for ponderous Liv Tyler period melodrama ONEGIN (imdb:
         duel / russia)? We advise asking for "One Gin" at the box
         office - "a double vodka and a packet of crisps!"...
         otherwise an exceptional week for offloading nondescript
         rubbish: loathsome Ray Winstone romantic comedy FANNY AND
         ELVIS; Claire Danes and Kate Beckinsale as drug-smuggling
         foreign jailbait in BROKEDOWN PALACE; inspiration-free
         Redbus horror sequel THE RAGE: CARRIE 2; and, on limited
         release, "monks prefer footy to boring old religion"
         cultural imperialism celebration THE CUP, whose trailer is
         indistinguishable from a Nike ad... finally, it's not a
         shelf heading at your local butchers, but the name of
         Harrison Ford/ Kristen "Lady Penelope" Scott Thomas's
         mid-life desperation romance RANDOM HEARTS (imdb comment:
         "'In a perfect world they never would have met.' In a
         perfect world filmmakers would think twice before embarking
         on adaptations of bad '80s novels"). After this and "Six
         Days, Seven Nights", what is it with Harrison Ford and plane
         crashes? Doesn't a guy his age have simpler ways of meeting
         available women?...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         COMPO&gt;&gt; You! Yes, you!  Do you use one of those "out of the
         office" autoresponder programs? You know, the one that
         ignores "Precedence:" headers? Don't deny it, we've got an
         inbox that says otherwise. Well, as a special offer to any
         subscribers who mail us anything that matches our magic
         regexp, this week we'll automatically send (free of charge)
         a special message: It could be an amusing Dave Barry quote,
         an ascii-art Bart Simpson, or even a randomly picked Project
         Guttenburg e-text. Share and Enjoy! And the best thing is,
         if your autoresponder is *really* broken, it's the gift that
         we'll keep on giving! (If you're not sure if you're eligible
         for our special offer please consult your mail
         administrator.  If a look of panic creeps across their face,
         do let us know.)
