</span><span class="item">         The Sexual Offences Amendment, introduced to bring the gay
         age of consent in line with those notorious heterosexuals,
         is now law, but the riveting Lords debate on the topic
         continues at the very home of frank sexual argy-bargy -  THE
         WEB! Welcome to <a href="http://www.ageofconsent.org.uk">www.ageofconsent.org.uk</a>, our favourite
         Baroness Thornton's own exercise in on-line democracy, where
         you too can vote on the controversial topic of what is
         scaring the peer's horses these days. There are, we should
         say, something a bit skewiff here. The explanation of
         exactly what you're voting for on the site is very
         confusing, with strong encouragements to vote with the good
         Baroness, whatever you originally thought. Also, they keep
         on saying the word "buggery", to the point where we began to
         forget what it meant. Finally, details of the individuals
         behind the site are strangely vague, apart from the credit
         to "the group who voted in favour of the House of Lords
         amendment". Although it would be nice to imagine that it's
         actually the Baroness who wrote the ColdFusion back-end
         (oops-la!), this does make it tricky to discover who to
         contact - should, say, you wish to query about the use of
         the site's personal data under the Data Protection Act
         (helpfully linked from their homepage in place of a proper
         privacy statement). That's certainly pertinent, given that
         in order to vote, you have to give your name, postcode - and
         your sexual orientation. Those of us who are a mite
         concerned about handing over a lucrative,
         geographically-detailed, pink pound marketing database to
         the Baroness shouldn't worry: One call to the Lords later,
         and we find it was the oddly reticent INTERACTIVE BUREAU who
         manage the site.  Unfortunately, as of "press send" time,
         they hadn't given us the precise details of the fat "data
         controller" contact required by law. So, in accordance with
         the data registrar's own recommendations, do send your firm,
         manly, request to have your most private recesses unhanded
         this instant to IAB's chief exec: RODNEY TYLER, INTERACTIVE
         BUREAU LONDON, HOLBORN GATE, 26 SOUTHAMPTON BUILDINGS,
         LONDON WC2A 1PJ.  We'll update that address as soon as they
         pull their finger out. Ahem.

</span><span class="item">         Surprises came thick and fast at this year's BIG BROTHER
         AWARDS: the absence of Mark Thomas (on "a sting" somewhere);
         Simon Davies and David Shayler taking the stage as "Men In
         Black"; endearingly amateurish home movies of Privacy
         International delivering awards to winners who couldn't make
         the ceremony. But the biggest turn-up for the bookies came
         when out-of-nowhere outsiders ENVISION TV LICENSING swept
         ahead of established favourites - including 192.com/ InfoDisc
         proprietors i-CD Publishing, automated face-recognition
         pioneers Visionics and, of course, Amazon.co.uk - to take
         "Most Invasive Company", thanks to their national database of
         26 million addresses plus what Davies described as "constantly
         hounding TV-free households to explain why they don't have a
         TV". To which we'd add: and requiring retailers, by law, to
         provide them with the names and addresses of anyone buying or
         renting a TV, digital set-top box, VCR, PC tuner card or
         "TV-enabled computer" in the UK, making the sale of Orwell's
         "telescreens" more strictly regulated here than, say, rifles
         and shotguns in the state of Florida. Now, we don't recall
         ever explicitly handing over these details when buying a telly
         (unless they get them direct from your credit card or bank),
         but if you're purchasing some TV-enabled consumer goods this
         Christmas, why not take along a large sum of cash and perhaps
         a "new" address as well, and do let us know how you get on...

         the Professor appears to be commemorating the start of his

         NTK's busy "Operations" division is the imminent prospect of
         our NEWTONMAS 2000 party, which now seems almost certain to
         take place on the evening of Saturday 2000-12-23, and to be
         some kind of tie-in with those groovy VXSLAB guys and LONDON
         2600 (who helped choose the date, explaining "Almost none of
         our lot are likely to be up to their elbows in family Xmas
         preparations"). Exactly *where* it's going to be - well,
         that's where you come in: if you know of, frequent, or own any
         reasonably central London venue that could accommodate up to
         several hundred geeks singing Cthulhu Christmas carols, do get
         in touch. Same applies if you have any video projection kit
         that you'd like to supervise at the event - or it'll be OHP
         acetates at Webshack or The Foundry again, you Scrooges...

         It's principal advantage is that almost all the UI is run
         from their own Website; you pick out the tracks you want
         queued for download, and the stubby little client merely
         chats occasionally to find out what's to be downloaded,
         where from, and who wants to upload. There are no
         permanently open ports, the client automatically
         auto-resumes downloads, and the CPU usage is miniscule. The
         Windows version (yes, there's a 200K CLI Linux client) even
         has bandwidth throttling. Meanwhile, that Audiogalaxy Web UI
         is *lovely*: it automatically sorts songs by artist, and
         does its best to eliminate broken files and consolidate good
         versions. It keeps track of files that have appeared in the
         past on the network, so you can select and queue them 
         for when they reappear. And because the selection and
         downloading process are separated, you can pick your tracks
         away from home, and have them auto-download remotely to your
         home machine. Heck, as an journalistic experiment, we even
         managed to set up a public repository of songs using a
         client running on a Webserver. It's exactly how Napster
         should be done - and there's even a potential revenue model
         for AG with banner ads and CD purchases. If wasn't for the
         fact that it's slightly more centralised than the Nap
         (making for some scaling issues), non-free (natch), and
         fucking doomed to be smashed into pieces by those RIAA folk,
         we'd say it's the future of MP3 distribution. As it is,
         we'll say that it's the all-too-brief present, and wait for
         the writs to fly.

         <a href="http://www.ntkmart.com">http://www.ntkmart.com</a> by midnight Monday 2000-12-11, then you
         might not get them before Christmas, assuming that was what
         you had in mind in the first place). Anyway, we've had
         reassuringly few complaints so far, all of which have been
         from either Americans or women. A "surprised and disgruntled"
         BRUCE STERLING led the US delegation, moaning that the "USA
         isn't even afforded on the pull-down menu!", while another
         citizen confessed to concerns about ordering via a proxy in
         the UK, that proxy being his "mother's septugenarian penpal
         from before the war". Sorry guys, this wasn't meant as a slur
         on your fine young nation; we genuinely thought you might have
         had enough of consumer items on that extensive landmass of
         yours. We did look into some lame cafepress.com alternative,
         but their print area is only 8" by 10", and our logos are all
         about 11" square. But we will let you know if we secure some
         sort US distributor and, if you are female, see if any of

         <a href="http://www.gyford.com/images/ntk_shirt.jpg">http://www.gyford.com/images/ntk_shirt.jpg</a> , to avoid nasty

         clearing your parody with the copyright-holders first, as at
         <a href="http://bofhcam.org/images/NTK.tif">http://bofhcam.org/images/NTK.tif</a> shows admirable initiative
         (though does anyone have any ideas for funny animals that we
         could use instead of the crowbar?)... and 2. Try and put the
         images on your own site, then send us the URLs, instead of
         just mailing us gigantic BMP files, which, if we didn't know
         someone who had a Windows machine, we wouldn't be able to
