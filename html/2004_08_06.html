</span><span class="item">         Last year, DAN SUGALSKI, lead developer of the forthcoming
         Perl6 virtual machine, Parrot, bet the Python developers
         that he could run Python faster on the fledgling VM - and the 
         creator of Python could throw a pie at him at the next OSCON if 
         he didn't. He didn't; the pie-ing was duly arranged. As
         everyone knows, while Perlites are chaotic/good trickster
         archetypes who love such events, Pythonistas are peaceful,
         have-their-glasses-on-a-little-string types, like hobbits or
         the Dutch. In the end, Guido van Rossum refused to throw the
         pie, and instead offered to share it as food with the Perl
         developers. Nothing, of course, could have been more
         guaranteed to throw Perlsters into violent rage. An extended
         period of acrimonious bargaining followed, in which the Perl
         crew grew more and more insistent that their own chief
         developer be humiliated, with many walking out of the
         session, muttering about "all foreplay and no sex". Later,
         the Perl faction took it upon themselves to pie Sugalski -
         much, we are sure, to the shock of the pacifistic Pythonese,
         who may well have planned that using their psychomathematics 
         and indented whitespace necromancy all along. (Mind
         you, that didn't stop Guido finally joining in. Feel the
         punctuation rising in you, Guido!)

         "Doom 3" with a token showing of arthouse road-movie filth THE 
         DOOM GENERATION (1.45am, next Fri, C4)...
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; reader DUNCAN ROBSON points out that the Spanish poster 
         <a href="http://www.cartelia.net/poster/24/yor.jpg">http://www.cartelia.net/poster/24/yor.jpg</a> suggests "worse than 
         previously feared levels of jiggyness" for CGI-heavy "Blade 
         Runner"-lite - and not in a bad way - Will Smith scifi romp 
         I, ROBOT ( <a href="http://www.cndb.com/movie.html?title=I%2C+Robot">http://www.cndb.com/movie.html?title=I%2C+Robot</a> : 
         Unlike Will Smith, [Kirstie Allsopp lookalike] Bridget 
         Moynahan's character can afford frosted glass around her 
         shower, so what you see is brief and not very clear. But it's 
         definitely not a double and her body looks great) - as NTK's 
         LEE MAGUIRE notes, the "real" US Robotics are much choosier 
         about their product placement than you might have thought:

         that, who on earth thought that Halle Berry's headgear looked 
         anything other than completely ridiculous in next week's 
         CATWOMAN? ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/catwoman.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/catwoman.htm</a> : 
         risking human life to save a cat; resurrection by the breath 
         of a cat; cat able to foresee future; much of [Berry's] upper 
         torso skin, including massive excessive cleavage exposure and 
         including below-navel skin - front and back, was fully 
         viewable by every thirteen year old (and younger) in the 
         audience. Slits and rips of various size in the pants of her 
         outfit bared even more skin in this, yet another R-13 
         including much of Berry's buttocks skin)...

         happened last week or might happen next week. You can read it
       on Friday afternoon or print it out then take it home if you have
     nothing better to do. It is compiled by NTK from stuff they get sent.
