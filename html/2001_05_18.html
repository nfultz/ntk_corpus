</span><span class="item">         Back into the Useless Net Awards season - tellingly muted
         this year, as sponsors, nominees, and award-giving bodies
         pray to remain solvent until the ceremonies. Especially
         quiet this year is NEW MEDIA AGE, whose effectiveness awards
         have been made a bit less effective by that 78UKP fee, it
         seems. A battered LESLIE BUNDER protested on UKNM that not
         only did they not tell him he wasn't nominated, they're not
         telling *anyone* who the shortlists are, because "the judges
         felt ... that some of the entries were very weak and that
         having a shortlist in advance will give away who the winners
         are". But we all know on the Internet, information wants to
         be free (or at the very least, a bit bloody cheaper than
         78UKP). Have you been nominated by NEW MEDIA AGE? Let us
         know, and we'll publish the full list ourselves, dammit. And
         if it's as obvious as they say, we'll give out the awards
         early too. Then you can ask for your money back...

</span><span class="item">         While we whine and gripe, others go off and do. Or moan and
         gripe at the right people, anyway. JASON KITCAT, disturbed
         as we by GATEWAY.GOV.UK's Unix-hippy-refusing policy [NTK
         2001-02-23], applied under the Freedom of Information Act to
         discover the reason. As is often the case with these
         requests, though, we're left with more questions than when
         we started. Excluding Unix machines continues to be a little
         odd (no API for accessing X.509 certificates on
         non-Windows/Mac platforms? Hunh?). Yet, while the fancy
         digital signature bit won't work with open source browsers,
         it turns out there was no reason to exclude them from the
         whole site, especially as that bit isn't working much yet
         anyway. "This [restriction] will be relaxed shortly", they
         say  - how shortly?. Meanwhile, the document reveals,
         there's now one more govt. sanctioned Public Key
         Infrastructure provider - Equifax. Yeah, the credit agency.
         We can't work out if they're evilly escrowing keys like the
         other official PKI, Entrust, yet. But we do know that for
         twenty-five quid, they'll id you for the government by
         grabbing your personal details, and cross-referencing them
         with your credit record. Not a sentence with many of our
         favourite words in it, that. The other (better) bit of news
         is the e-envoy is looking for an open source alternative to
         both these companies. Those nice netproject people got the
         contract to research this: Doc Andrew Findlay has the helm,
         if you'd like to get involved.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Not to be confused with NESTLE'S KITCAT of course, one of the
         multinational brands indirectly causing trouble for Bristol-
         based "video activists" I-CONTACT. In a posting to noted agit-
         prop forum The Mark Thomas Mailing List, someone claiming to
         be from I-Contact says they were promised "full editorial
         control" over a short film they were making for Channel4 -
         control which did not, however, appear to extend to annoying
         specific corporations or encouraging breaking the law. Since
         the film covered Adbusters-style subvertising and billboard
         modification, that counted out their planned coverage of the
         likes of <a href="http://www.subvertise.org/politics/spol0012m.html">http://www.subvertise.org/politics/spol0012m.html</a> ,
         <a href="http://www.subvertise.org/corporations/scor0010m.html">http://www.subvertise.org/corporations/scor0010m.html</a> , or

         plus footage of a billboard being pulled down, and ultimately
         led to I-Contact's withdrawal of the film (or whatever was
         left of it). What puzzles us is why they didn't follow the
         example of the BAFTA-award-winning "So Graham Norton" who,
         when faced with a mildly contentious or hard-to-clear website,
         ingeniously faked their entire coverage of it.

         SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL AWARDS (from 2pm, Sat 2001-05-19,
         the Science Museum, UKP7.95, free after 4.30pm), will have
         slightly more of a campaigning element, as nominees and
         interested parties (including Stephen Baxter, Ken MacLeod,

         general? An undemanding public? Those lazy grant-obsessed
         boffins for not building more space stations? Or, as event
         organiser Pat Cadigan theorises, the star-people themselves,
         for hiding the first two monoliths so successfully that we
         (and our monkey ancestors) never found either of them?

</span><span class="item">         It's sickening but no surprise to us that MINDGUARD, the
         handy anti-psychotronic warfare utility, has finally caught
         the eye of the Powers That Be. That said, we *had* expected
         retaliatory strikes from liberati-controlled IR-enabled
         spy-satellites, not a sniffy letter from lawyers of Kortech,
         current commercial exploiters of the Roswell-derived
         mind-control ray patent. However "softee softee catchee
         monkee" the hegemony strikes, it's still only a matter of
         time before the NANOG Cabal take down Zapato's original
         distribution. Accordingly, we can only hope that someone
         mirrors this program, which remeains the only Amiga and Unix
         app for deciphering, jamming - and potentially, hackers,
         rebroadcasting - beamed messages from the UN, CIA, FBI, and
         the Antartic Relay, as well as signals from the transmitter
         array occupying the apparent territory of the non-existent
         "decoy" state of Belgium (independently-minded Douglas Adams
         fans mourning his seemingly accidental death: thinker
         harder, you gulls). Source is available under Mindguard's
         own MPL: potential redistributors should audit the Mindguard
         program carefully, not only for signs of tampering, but also
         amazing revelations about the true nature of the 'rand()'
         function.

         now purchase official NTK merchandise from our intermittently
         updated <a href="http://www.ntkmart.com/">http://www.ntkmart.com/</a> e-commerce site, a process
         which has been nominally beta-tested by Geekpride Bostonian
         TIM MCEACHERN (or "Foot and Mouth Tim", as he now expects to
         be known). Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans can
         confidently expect to be next in our international expansion -
         though isn't it winter over there or something? Wrap up warm,
         for heaven's sake!... admittedly, we've fallen slightly behind
         on our intended "new t-shirt every month" schedule - for a
         start, we had to punish Cybercandy for that nasty accidental
         spamming incident - but we aim to make up for that with the
         first competition winner in our SUMMER COLLECTION 2001: the
         face of "a well-known usability guru", wearing glasses and a
         beret, with the word "Usability!" graffitied underneath
         (really, it makes more sense when you see it), as submitted by
         famed Yahoo Serious lookalike (without the afro) MATT JONES
         <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1334000/1334092.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/uk/newsid_1334000/1334092.stm</a> .
         Matt has nobly offered to donate his UKP2 royalty from each
         shirt to an organisation that promotes web accessibility and
         usability, but we haven't heard back from them yet about
         whether they're OK with their name appearing on the site, so
         you'll have to trust us on that one. Incidentally, we've
         already raised more than UKP400 for the Redundant Technology
         Initiative through sales of the "Elite" and "ILoveYou.VBS"
         designs, part of which they want to spend on printing some
         shirts of their own, of which more later... completely missing
         the point (but in a good way), CHRISTIAN PINDER wrote to say
         "thanks for creating an Elite - The New Kind (Elite-TNK)
         t-shirt", referring of course to his similarly acronymed C
         port: <a href="http://home.clara.net/cjpinder/elite.html">http://home.clara.net/cjpinder/elite.html</a> , while MARTIN
         RODGERS wanted to know if we were "using sweatshops" to
         produce any of our products, and did not seem reassured by our
         initial response that they're all made by the respected US
         brand Fruit Of The Loom, so "No worries there!". Though this

         Subvert The Mass Media, Get One Free" competition (full round-
