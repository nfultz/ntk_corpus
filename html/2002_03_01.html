</span><span class="item">         Forget Bob Dylan, Tony Bennett, Billy Joel - the most moving
         performance at this week's GRAMMY AWARDS came from old-time
         crooner Michael Greene, President of the National Academy of
         Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, who waxed lyrical on the subject of
         the "comfort, solace and sweet celebration" that "the power of
         music" brings to the world. But then the lighting changed, the
         backing switched to monks chanting over a gothic trip-hop beat
         and, striding through the dry ice swirling across the stage,
         Greene went on to rap about how he'd personally witnessed the
         hood's darker side, where MP3 fans stole bands' livelihoods
         "one digital file at a time" - it's "out of control and oh so
         criminal", he wailed. The number ended with a cautionary tale
         of three kids he knew who fell in with a bad crowd, downloaded
         thousands of songs in a Morpheus binge, and are now presumably
         in the custody of the relevant authorities. Tragically, we
         don't have an audio recording of this potential floor-filler,
         but if anyone out there does, wouldn't it make a great remix
         anthem for our "World Wide Web/ of theft and indifference"?
         Also, from the way things are going, it sounds like he might
         just appreciate the royalties.

</span><span class="item">         We always thought the biggest danger to placing WiFi
         antennae on the roof was the pancake-shaped radiation
         pattern of those darned omnis. Well, let this be a lesson in
         perspective (and sadly, parallax). ROB FLICKENGER, 802.11
         advocate and handy author of O'Reilly's "Building Wireless
         Community Networks" nearly did a Rod Hull last week, falling
         from two floors up while setting up a point-to-point net
         link. He's out of the hospital now, but spent some time in
         intensive surgery to fix some serious internal injuries. As
         we all know, there's no Nutshell guide for that. "No amount
         of bandwidth is worth your physical harm", say the O'Reilly
         kids. We're not backtracking that far: but please do send
         someone else up instead of you. You know what you're like.

         After a hiatus of seven years, popular Commodore childish
         thing ZZAP64 is back! A dot-for-dot prepress continuation of
         the iconic eighties games mag, it would be churlish to
         report that the hi-res file is over thirty megs (482,031
         times more than the unexpanded 64 could handle) in
         6502-unreadable PDF format. The point is perfect
         verisimilitude. So, making their reappearance, good or bad:
         Ken D. Fish and his "helper" - old Zzap editor Gordon
         Houghton, POKE pages, caricatures of gurning thumb-raising
         journalists, kneejerk dissing of Amiga and Spectrum users
         who don't know the war is over, letters that conclude
         that "Despite all the anti-aliased 3D flashiness of today,
         there still isn't anything to touch Paradroid", and a very
         senile White Wizard. New aspects to the magazine include
         soft-erotica adverts for Emily "Bits" Booth's "memorabilia"
         Website (presumably filling in for the absence of Miss
         Whiplash), and over a dozen C64 fanatics who have
         desperately fantasised about being on the Zzap contributor's
         list for over a decade. In some ways, it's a bit like
         watching Paul Darrow reprise Avon with no budget and a
         ship-full of aging, grinning, Blake's 7 fans.

         win the hotly contested "Most Invasive Company" category at
         Monday's BIG BROTHER UK AWARDS (from 6pm, 2002-03-04, the
         LSE's Hong Kong Theatre, London WC2). This seems largely on
         the strength of the pro-hunting lobby's enthusiasm for storing
         the "Habits", "Sexual life" and "Criminal intelligence" of
         current, past and potential offenders, competitors, students,
         minors and anyone else they don't like the look of, right down
         there at the end of their lengthy entry in the Data Protection
         Register. Now, according to this online search facility, event
         organisers Privacy International don't appear to have a DPR
         entry themselves, so does that mean anyone can just turn up
         and claim to already be on their list?

         Ars "too platform-independent to last the dawn" Technica,
         and written by Ars forum member Aryeh Holzer (no relation to
         Jenny), this Windows service is the anti-cronjob. Once
         configured, it'll sit in the background, and unless you
         reset its clock every week (or month, or day, by your
         command), it'll assume you've been offed and proceed to
         encrypt incriminating files, send e-mail to friends,
         relatives and enemies, and - of course - enter "Posthumous
         Coward" postings to your favourite Web forums. This does
         rather depend on your uptime being shorter than that of your
         Windows server. But we can see to that.

         of all literature in FAHRENHEIT 451 (1.05am, Fri, BBC2)...

         unfriendly serious documentaries to somewhere where even fewer
         people will watch them, in a simultaneous transmission of the

         digital to catch dotcom disaster docu STARTUP.COM later in the
         week (10.15pm, Mon, BBC4 KNOWLEDGE or whatever it's called)...

         can (like on the back cover); "This will be Greg Egan's

         reader MARTIN BACON to point out that "[it] is not a parody.
         It is a burlesque, and a pretty crude one. The whole point of
         a parody is that you get well into it before realising the

         on page 1 para 1. The authors admit this in the introduction,

         his timeless THE COMPLETE D.R. AND QUINCH, though reader BEN

         DARK KNIGHT 2, admitting that it's "bonkers" and pinning his
         hopes on the eventual conclusion of Warren Ellis' MINISTRY OF
