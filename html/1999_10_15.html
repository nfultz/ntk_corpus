</span><span class="item">         In a week where LOCALTEL got rapped by the Advertising
         Standards Authority (and Tempo announced they were
         withdrawing the 0800 services CDs from their store), and
         the extremely unresponsive 08004U gang got their shoulders
         felt by Dundee's Trading Standards Officers, the "really
         free" 0800 ISP market is looking like even more of a Del
         and Rodney world than ever. So the entry of freewheeling
         telco TELINCO isn't entirely unexpected. The telco has spent
         the last few days noisily denying everything about
         skunkworks STRAY DUCK project, except that it's probably
         highly revolutionary, comes on a freephone number, and is
         currently the subject of a somewhat naff teaser campaign on
         <a href="http://www.strayduck.com">www.strayduck.com</a>. Theories, gentlemen? Given Telinco's
         somewhat buccaneering approach to the telecommunications
         market in the past - and the tempting but temporary IPO
         conditions in the UK right now - we'd hazard another smoke-
         and-mirrors payment system, funded by a speedy public
         offering and a lot of frenetic press coverage. Oh, and a
         pretty swift re-branding, if they've got any sense.

</span><span class="item">         Wednesday saw the announcement on Nettime of the ICA's
         latest network net work: "Warez Installation Art" - an ftp
         server running on one of the New Media Centre's expensive
         machines, aimed at "creating our own virtual warez based
         community in celebration of the BBS gangs of the Eighties".
         Who'd have thought that the ICA could manage to sponsor a
         decent bit of net.art, for once? Certainly not the ICA, who
         had no idea that someone had wandered in, cracked one of
         their many idle Sun boxes and then published an open ftp
         account for everyone to use. As is the way of all warez, the
         site was removed after a few hours (in the interim, New
         Media Centre staff were overheard wondering aloud why their
         network was "so slow today"). There was, though, enough time
         for the upload of few genuinely intriguing pieces of ANSI
         art, a cracked MP3 encoder (for Linux!), and, de rigeur, the
         GNU manifesto. Anyone attempting to upload a clue got
         stopped by the ICA firewalls, apparently.

         Marshall wrote to point out a strong competitor for lamest
         Net story prize to The Observer's white paper on virtual
         drugs in the News Of The World. Extra points for a
         gratuitous Johnny Mnemonic mention, as well as a full
         picture of his cybernetically-enhanced sidekick, Professor
         Kevinny Warwic. And JO CHIPCHASE wrote in - for once, not to
         ask for unpaid help on an article she's writing - but to
         complain about the the poor taste of our Paddington coverage
         last week. It's a fair cop (although in our defence, you
         should have seen what we were *going* to write). Still,
         judging from the non-reaction to our Springfield massacre
         funnies, time heals all wounds. While we're waiting, we'll
         do the standard media trick of pointing to other people's
         sick humour and tutting disapproval while you forward it to
         your mates.

         profits on? Beach-side condo? Original Leonardo sketches? A
         packet of Monster Munch? Given that these online book stores
         can't even make a buck on the other 85%, might it be a
         better idea to put your pennies to work on something more
         worthwhile? Just like Amazon, GIVEQUICK is a non-profit
         startup which redirects your affiliate revenues to the
         charity of your choice. Admittedly, the choice at the moment
         is very US-of-A-o-centric, but the kindly Webmasters promise
         to introduce more "foreign" groups soon, and if you're a

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; with their usual contempt for complex story arcs, ITV
         runs definitive hidden-identity actioner DIE HARD (9pm, Fri,
         ITV) then, same time next week, dire Jeremy Irons camp-fest
         DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE (9pm, Fri, etc) - without the
         vital character development of the second "bridging"
         episode, Die Hard 2: Die Harder... sticking with the
         classics, C5 wheels out FASTER PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL!
         (12.25am, Fri, C5) for the second time this year (last shown
         Christmas Eve '98)... and Jason "George Costanza" Alexander
         and Ron "Bakersfield PD" Eldard take some of the acting
         pressure off Cameron Diaz in odd little dinner-party black
         comedy THE LAST SUPPER (10pm, Sat, C4)... PAXMAN INTERVIEWS
         BILL GATES (8pm, Sun, BBC2) - hopefully shouldn't be too
         sycophantic - towards *Jeremy Paxman!*... endless cartoon
         slot DOPE SHEET (12.20am, Sun, C4) returns with a look at
         animation online (GIFs, Shockwave, Flash, you name it)...
         while self-explanatory new docu series MILLENNIUM: A
         THOUSAND YEARS OF HISTORY (7.10pm, Mon, BBC2) doesn't seem
         to be particularly closely based on the Chris Carter/ Lance
         Henriksen sci-fi drama of the same name... "they're still
         writing, but who cares?" is the theme of the first in a new
         run of BOOKWORM (7.30pm, Tue, BBC2), featuring Sue "Adrian
         Mole" Townsend and geneticist Steve "car advert" Jones...
         and TOMORROW'S WORLD (7.30pm, Wed, BBC1) continues its slide
         into terminal self-parody with a gadget to help a blind
         driver break the land speed record, followed by an
         essentially similar format in SPECULATE (8pm, Wed, BBC1),
         where Gaby Roslin makes the audience guess the outcome of
         bizarre challenges: eg which will fly further when fired
         from a cannon - a bed or a bath?...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; maybe HEAT MAGAZINE has overlooked some of Samuel L 
         Jackson's previous work (eg little-known critics' favourite
         "Pulp Fiction") causing them to trumpet "a virtual absence
         of stars... who needs A-list names anyway" in their widely
         distributed "40 Things You Must Not Miss This Autumn" flyer
         mention of gorgeously daft CGI shark chaser DEEP BLUE SEA
         (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a> : a foul mouth "pastor"
         mixing vulgar talk with the Scriptures; urinating in the
         open; shark consumption of another shark; drinking an
         alcoholic beverage for relief; explosively startling
         programming; stark insane terror; continuous threat). A cute
         cast and a couple of genuine surprises contribute to Renny
         "Die Hard 2" Harlin's most disciplined film yet, like Alien
         4 done properly or something... anyway, bites the head off
         GREGORY'S 2 GIRLS (imdb comment: "The worst film I have ever
         seen") - John Gordon Sinclair (but not Clare Grogan)
         returns as an adult teacher still besotted with schoolgirls;
         a promising angle swiftly discarded in favour of a Famous
         Five-style romp involving an evil electronics factory...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FOOD COURT&gt;&gt; reader MICHAEL MAYER is our expert witness for
         the defence of the new DARK KIT KAT (normal Kit Kat price),
         claiming "The chocolate is much better quality than usual
         milk chocolate". The prosecution meanwhile rests on two key
         facts: 1. The undeniably suspicious Vader-style invitation
         to "Have a *dark* break" on the back, and 2. It's one of
         three brands NESTLE is subjecting to what they call "Flavour
         Craver" marketing: overwhelming the public with what they
         think are their favourite flavours all in one go, other
         current examples being of course all-orange SMARTIES and
         all-red-and-black FRUIT PASTILLES - a revolting concept if
         you try it too often... juries are mildly unimpressed with
         the KFC TWISTER (2.49 solus; 3.49 with drink and fries) -
         essentially slightly spicier chicken burger bits wrapped in
         a tortilla rather than a bun, and a lot trickier to eat
         without bits falling out than the attractive Cornetto-style
         advertising suggests... some further fast-food updates at
         the edible NTK tribute site <a href="http://www.gastropod.co.uk/">http://www.gastropod.co.uk/</a>
         though, sadly, it's now gone on publishing hiatus (oh, so
         often the way) before we had to upgrade it to "threat"...
         interactive sweet of the week remains the CHUPA CHUPS
         KIT-POP (some newsagents, a quid or so?) - the standard CC
         lolly presented in ingenious flip-out Swiss Army knife
         package, complete with ruler, biro, eraser and pencil...
         and finally, largely to torment ZD Net's Chris Long, the
         PIII 450 <a href="http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/1999/34/ns-9575.html">http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/1999/34/ns-9575.html</a> he
         was once so cross about was this week spotted in some large
         Sainsburys at UKP650 - positioned perilously close, perhaps,
         to another well-thought-out new Sainsbury's line, Monster
         Munch-style maize snacks that hold the dubious honour of
         being maybe the 2000th product to call themselves
         "Millennium Bugs". "EAT THEM UP BEFORE THEY WIPE YOU OUT!"
         suggests the packet, threateningly (their capitals)...
