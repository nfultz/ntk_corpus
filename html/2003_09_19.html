</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Everyone (including us) moans about the uselessness of the
         new UK anti-spam legislation which is so set about with
         provisos as to be next to useless. It's not all bad, though.
         Come December 11th, we can sue spammers for damages, giving
         the vague possibility of forming a big scary anti-spam
         posse, demanding our thrupenny SMTP charges en masse.
         Subscriber James Smith has been practicing his hue and cry
         on TV company MAST MEDIA. They sent him the world's most
         cumbersome would-be viral last week: a whole *four megs* of
         unsolicited attachment. It all seems to be down to optimistic
         TV micro-producers thrashing in their own Outlook-soaked
         Barley idiocy: but think of the fun when we can charge them
         for the dial-up phone call! Yeah, we know it's not a
         solution. But dreams of revenge may have to do for now.
</span><span class="trailing_urls">         <a href="http://www.floppy.org.uk/stuff/mastmedia/">http://www.floppy.org.uk/stuff/mastmedia/</a>

                  - supporting an entire ancillary industry, you know
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Though, as Mast Media pointed out, it's sometimes tricky to 
         tell the difference between "viral marketing" and "an attempt 
         to encourage friends and colleagues to watch a preview of our 
         new TV show". In the light of last weekend's revelations about 
         the spoof spam designed to harvest login details of BARCLAYS 
         ONLINE customers, reader ANT MITCHELL was understandably 
         concerned when he received a mail directing him to a non-SSL'd 
         page instructing him to type in details like name, postcode 
         and "the last nine digits of your credit card number" to win 
         "1000 points" on his Goldfish card. The site, with the 
         reassuringly official URL of "goldfish.xdbs.co.uk", appeared 
         to be hosted by easily.co.uk who, nonetheless, didn't take it 
         down - because it was subsequently established to be a genuine 
         offer from the clearly security-conscious Goldfish themselves. 
         Goldfish said they'd "pass on" these comments to whoever's 
         running the site; Ant wonders how many valid credit card 
         numbers could be generated given the last 9 digits and "a bit 
         of Perl".

         - and "legitimate" marketers aren't really helping with this
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Oh, and that RIP Statutory Instrument we mentioned last week
         has finally been published. It doesn't get debated until
         next month, so we'll save boring you with the details until
         nearer the time - but it's not looking good. No Egg
         Marketing Board, but the local council still gets a good
         peek at your phone logs. What's needed, we think, is some
         extra legislation to provide more accountability and
         horribly punish the people who misuse this data: either with
         four megabyte attachments or prison, whichever is worse.

         HOUSE this weekend (various London venues, all free), but if 
         that doesn't offer quite enough goatee-stroking potential for 
         your liking, you may also appreciate advance warning of the 
         LUMEN INTERNATIONAL MEDIA ARTS EVOLUTION (various venues 
         around Leeds, from Thu 2003-10-09 to Sat 2003-10-11, day 
         passes from UKP18.00) - an event which unselfconsciously 
         describes one of its "highlights" as a chat between "leading 
         postmodern sociologist Zygmunt Bauman and artistic activist 
         Gustav Metzger, two of the most uncompromising thinkers of the 
         twentieth century". And, if you left early, you could still 
         get to London in time for CYBERSALON's dinner with high-
         pitched hype-monger DOUGLAS RUSHKOFF (7pm, Sat 2003-10-11, 
         London Sketch Club SW3, "donations from UKP35.00"). The online 
         menu whets your appetite with "Vegetable and gruyere gallette 
         served with oyster mushrooms, asparagus, and salsa verdi", but 
         you can of course always rely on Rushkoff to serve up his own 
         generous helpings of half-baked techno bollocks, marinated in 
         new-age emergent optimism, with a choice of vasopressin or LSD 
         dressings.

</span><span class="item">         A-A-P is all wrong. Worse, the more you use it, the more you
         like how wrong it is. It's a generic package configuration,
         compiler and installer (yeah, another one) which uses Python
         (huh?) and runs on Windows and Unix. It has enough smart
         defaults so you can create multi-platform installable
         packages almost instantly. It has a UI element (what?)
         called "Agile" that helps you build and test your install
         recipes. Agile is fairly minimal - to begin with. But as you
         use it, all your other favourite packages begin to pop in
         and say hello. Gdb and gcc seemlessly appear when you try to
         execute debug code. Look twice at an editable file, and Vim
         pops up, and starts listing code - with breakpoints, and
         watch variables. We still have no idea how it does that. Boa
         Constructor, the Python IDE, also introduces itself. It's as
         if someone - say, Bram Moolenaar, author of Vim and A-A-P,
         was smuggling his Vim cohorts into the world of
         fully-featured IDEs,  and getting away with it. A-A-P's
         still in development, but is already very useable. And Bram's
         got some big Euro prize money for folk who want to extend it
         in interesting ways. God knows if it will get enough
         followers to gain traction in the world of package systems:
         but it's sufficiently exotic and fiddleable to be worth a look.
