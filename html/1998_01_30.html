         of Pies" napkin, ate up DIGITAL "big in the seventies"
         EQUIPMENT this week for a cool $9.6 billion. Compaq
         promised not to spit out any of DEC's UNIX or VMS users,
         but, you know, those Windows NT platters look veerry
         tempting. Meanwhile, 72 year old DEC founder Ken Olsen must
         be spitting chips: it was he who in 1977 said "there's no
         reason why anyone would want a computer in their home".
         Meanwhile, if you're wondering what this means for you, use
         this simple mnemonic for the company's roadmap: Microsoft
         will own the software, Intel will own the processor, Compaq
         will own the hardware platform, and they will all own yo
         ass.

</span><span class="item">         Bad news for cypherpunks who thought legislation against
         strong crypto had been laughed out of court. Jack Straw, it
         seems, has been nobbled by the "lock up these PGP
         guerrillas and throw away their keys" contingent. At a
         meeting of European Justice ministers in Birmingham this
         week, Jack said "we are using 19th century procedures to
         pursue 21st century criminals" - the standard argument for
         introducing key-grabbing policies. And despite a
         conspicuous lack of evidence for these "Flash Gordons of
         crime", a smokescreen that could hide the governments'
         crypto U-turn is beginning to billow. In the latest edition
         of COMPUTER WEEKLY, sources suggest that Downing Street
         "will have no objection to potential certificate
         authorities offering key recovery encryption. However, any
         such services might have to provide access to law
         enforcement agencies, for example in the prevention of
         terrorism." So, they've played the terrorist card. Now,
         it's just a matter of bringing up the evil pornographers
         and drug barons...

</span><span class="item">         Shy retiring billionaire Bill G. went on a publicity
         offensive this week: emphasis, unfortunately for him, on
         "offensive". In Silicon Valley, he tried the libertarian-
         fighting-State guise, saying that it was intolerable that
          third-parties were crippling his products (rather than, as
         is traditional, the other way around). He also said that
         Microsoft was being picked on for being too "sexy": "We
         have a very sexy industry", he said, "if you worked for the
         Department of Justice, which would you rather investigate -
         - bread or software?". I don't know - are bakers demanding
         you buy the rest of your food from them? Watch out for
         repeats of his Friday ABC TV interview, in which Bill is
         interrogated by the usual razor-sharp US interview
         techniques ("Now Mr Gates, sir, perhaps we could move on to
         your favourite colour?"). Then we'll see how far he can
         take this "too sexy for your courts" meme.

         they're cheating, and getting 3rd-world sweat labour to

         at this week's Amusement Trade Exhibition International
         (see NTK 23/01/98), and now comes with: Simultaneous two-
         player link-ups (from different perspectives - though no
         deathmatch mode)! Same recoiling guns, new System 23
         graphics (whatever that means)! And, sadly, enemies wearing
         body armour! According to the brochure, "players also
         benefit from perceived added value - when their time runs
         out a life is lost and play continues". Also new at the
         ATEI, the usual mix of Sega Rally 2, novelty photo booths,
         and mad Japanese fishing sims - but no sign of genuine
         terror-engines like TOP ELIMINATOR (from Canada's
         ThrillTime Entertainment), a "genuine" 0-75mph dragster
         ride that sets new records for ratio of attraction
         cost/duration.

         forgiven for assuming that THE GRAND (9pm, Fri, ITV) is
         actually a fly-on-the-wall docu about the staff of a hotel
         who like dressing up in period costumes... E Nesbit,
         Tolkien, Dr Seuss - some promising choices for the classic
         kids' authors profiled in AN AWFULLY BIG ADVENTURE (6pm,
         Sat, BBC2) - but where's cutaway king Richard Scarry?...
         Saturday night: kill yourself - it's an Ecstacy
         criminalisation debate on C4, or (god, no) another lame Wil
         "Wesley Crusher" Wheaton movie on ITV... plus, over on
         satellite, woeful wannabe waste-of-disk-space HACKERS
         (10pm, Sat, Sky Movies 2) - notwithstanding its freeze-
         frame and RISC/ "PCI bus" chat-up lines... FITZ (10pm, Sun,
         ITV) is the oddly pointless US remake of Cracker... Data
         gets emotions in Kirk/ Picard romp STAR TREK: GENERATIONS
         (7.10pm, Sun, BBC1) - though, notably, not including
         disgust at his dreadful make-up... WATCHDOG HEALTHCHECK

         high-functioning autistic disorder Asperger's Syndrome...
         politico-prankster Mark Thomas bangs on about tax exempt
         properties in LIE OF THE LAND (7.50pm, Mon-Thu, C4)... and
         not too many rollercoaster disasters in the behind-the-
         scenes look at Blackpool PLEASURE BEACH (9.30pm, Mon, BBC1)
         - just another attempt to make a drama out of a
         workplace... the Watch The Skies season audibly scrapes the

         with Darin "brother of Glen" Morgan now writing better

         ultraviolent troubles-drama RESURRECTION MAN (imdb: not
         listed!)... more gritty Britty life-on-the-street frolics

         a magic act, though cheery sitcom bloke James Bolam does
         get turned into an evil pimp... and finally, it's got Bill
         "Twister" Paxton, Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg, and Julianna
         "ER" Margulies, but TRAVELLER (imdb: con-artists / drama)
