</span><span class="item">         Out of Africa into the British courts: a shut-the-hell-up
         order from DINERS CLUB, demanding that ROSS ANDERSON AND
         HIS CANTAB CRYPTO LEAGUE stop being quite so clever
         forthwith. Ross' Cambridge team had been asked in as expert
         witnesses in a South African "phantom ATM withdrawal" case
         against the international credit card. Were, the
         prosecution asked them, cashpoints really as secure as the
         defence made them out to be? Hold on, said Ross, we'll
         check. A few weeks later, Mike Bond and Piotr Zielinksi
         uncovered that - despite endless security controls - a bank
         insider could crack a cashpoint card's PIN number on an
         internal bank network in an average of fifteen tries. One
         employee could saunter off with seven thousand ATM PINs in
         half an hour, making an easy two million quid out of their
         lunchbreak. This is not the sort of detailed exploit that
         Citibank, the owners of Diner's Club, would like widely
         known. They have therefore commenced legal shutupshutup
         proceedings. And if Citibank's plea succeeds, we're sure
         everyone who reads the analysis (now mirrored at Cryptome)
         will do their best to forget it. Not to mention anyone else
         who worked out the exploit (which has existed since the
         first ATMs were rolled out) and put it to good use.

</span><span class="item">         So what killed FAXYOURMP.COM this week? Was it the issue
         that's been on the mind of the British public most in the
         past few weeks? But of course! And according to messages
         slicing into FAXYOURMP.COM, everybody in the world was very
         very concerned about the Anti-Hunting Bill. And curiously,
         they were all concerned using exactly the same words. Top
         charity the RSPCA sent out a mail requesting that their fans
         all write an identical, pre-written message to their MP and
         send it via FaxYourMP.com, a free service (which NTK is more
         than in cahoots with). A free service, incidentally, that
         specifically asks you *not* to cut and paste, because MPs
         just throw spammy pre-recorded messages into the bin. But
         there's more. Taking a leaf out of those viral marketeers,
         the RSPCA requested that everyone forward their mail to
         their friends - a mail which, incidentally, had no date on
         it, so could potentially continue bouncing around the Net for
         years. The result: MPs complaining, overloaded servers, and
         the fax service down for 48 hours - delaying other
         constituents' perhaps more original messages. Of course,
         the FYMPers have been a model of restraint throughout. After
         digging up their server, they put a block on the boilerplate
         text, redirecting animal lovers to a message that encourages
         them to re-word their mail in their own words. Of course,
         the message does end with the intimation that should the RSPCA
         try this again, "the puppy gets it" - which seems to be the
         only language these animal-lovers understand.

         could forget the implausible cyberchat scene in Patrick
         Marber's "Closer", Samantha Fox's scorching performance in
         "Virus: The Cyber Musical", or Alton Towers' skating
         spectacular "Webmaster On Ice"? Nevertheless, we have high
         hopes for MAKB3TH (various venues around East Anglia, from Thu
         2003-03-06, from UKP4), which sets Shakespeare's Scottish play
         on board the world's first free data haven, established by a
         "community of libertarian cypherpunks" on an abandoned oil
         platform in the North Sea. Even more excitingly, in addition
         to those boring old-fashioned "actors", it uses SMS, ASCII
         video footage, a techno soundtrack, a bunch of Matrox video
         cards and RedHat 7.3 to "create a dark piece of modern,
         digital theatre", with big TV screens and text messages and
         all. Sticking with the classics, March also sees a day of
         readings of Aristophanes' LYSISTRATA, culminating in a show
         at 7:30pm, Mon 2003-03-03, the Pleasance Theatre, London N7,
         UKP5. This is the Ancient Greek anti-war comedy with the large
         leather phallus and the women who go on "sex strike", and is
         not included here solely for the benefit of the NTK reader we
         met at an arty event we'd previously recommended, who declared
         himself very impressed by "the ratio". "The ratio?", we asked,
         innocently. Yes, he explained. The Ratio.

         First it was Chimera deciding that all work had to stop
         while they came up with a new name. Then it was Phoenix
         deciding that all development should slow to a crawl - and
         they had to come up with a new name too. Now it's Galeon,
         which keeps the name, but loses one of its developers, Marco
         Pesenti Gritti, who has gone off to code EPIPHANY. EPIPHANY,
         like its Galeon forefather, is a slimmed-down, GNOME-driven
         HTML displayer. Unlike Galeon (and like GNOME 2.2), Gritti
         plans to strip down all the interface and prefs to a bare
         minimum. It's early days, though, and the work is still a
         bit patchy: any UI that needs you to read a review before
         you can work out how to use bookmarks or create toolbars
         isn't quite there. It's also still dealing with the niggly
         focussing issues that pester any keyboard-driven GUI app.
         But if you're tired of waiting for Phoenix to coagulate, or
         you want a project to Safari-fy Gecko, this might be the
         place to look.

         demonstrated by live-action manga movie FIST OF THE NORTH STAR
         (12.45am, Fri, BBC1)... yet somehow he must have missed the
         casting call for THE FIFTH ELEMENT (12.30am, Sat, ITV), which
         has everyone else in it, ever... repeated WW1 docu THE GREAT
         WAR (6.20pm, Sat, BBC2) is preceded by its unfortunately-named
         making-of THAT WAS THE GREAT WAR THAT WAS (5.40pm, Sat,
         BBC2)... and Jon Snow *is* "Q" from "Star Trek", as he puts
         AMERICA ON TRIAL (6.45pm, Sat, C4)... BBC1 counterprogrammes
         Quentin Tarantino's least self-indulgent - and arguably most
         enjoyable - script, FROM DUSK TILL DAWN (11.20pm, Sat, BBC1),
         against the dubious delights of C4's JACKASS NIGHT (from
         10.55pm, Sat, C4)... for all you bewildered Sunday-morning
         viewers, REVELATIONS (11.30am, Sun, C5) is indeed a religious
         romp made by the nutty New Zealanders behind "The Tribe":

         and, set a year after the first film, routine Jennifer Love
         Hewitt slasher I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER (10pm,
         Sun, C4) should of course technically be called "I Still Know
         What You Did Two Summers Ago"... art critic Jonathan Meades
         shows how to make a supermarket sausage in MEADES EATS
         (7.30pm, Mon, BBC2)... the carnage continues in dire Angelina
         Jolie "Silence Of The Lambs" wannabe THE BONE COLLECTOR (9pm,
         Mon, C5)... don't let Michael Bay actioner THE ROCK (9pm, Wed,
         C5) distract you from the digital debut of George from
         Seinfeld's genius Larry-Sanders-style post-sitcom CURB YOUR
         ENTHUSIASM (10.30pm, Wed, BBC4)... while C5's double bill
         of NATIONAL LAMPOON'S EUROPEAN VACATION (8pm, Thu, C5) plus
         BASIC INSTINCT (10pm, Thu, C5) offers a relatively highbrow
         alternative to ITV's SLEEPING WITH CELEBRITIES (10.30pm, Thu,
         ITV) and extreme martial arts kickboxing celeb contest CAGE
         COMBAT (11.30pm, Thu, ITV)...
