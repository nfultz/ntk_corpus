</span><span class="item">         Tip to Lastminute: the trick with these flotations is to
         give a chance for your original investors to sell out before
         the hoi-polloi take a look at the long-term prospects, then
         run out of the market screaming. Indeed, the biggest problem
         with lastminute's punt was that just how obviously they were
         putting the boat out too early (obvious, except for maybe
         hacks blinded by the instant human interest appeal of Martha
         Lane Fox). For one thing, it was painted all over the
         prospectus. As NTK subscriber Alex Balfour writes: "from the
         prospectus details, and my calculations, at a minimal budget
         of 5.5 million, Lastminute needs to make around 403,500
         sales a year to make ends meet. Judging by their current
         subscriber/purchase ratio, that requires 207,000 paying
         users - or 15.8 million subscribers overall. If they carry
         on spending 25 million a year, they need to sell 2 million items.
         Which requires 78 million subscribers - or more than the
         entire population of the UK." Actually, we're not too
         worried about Lastminute surviving: but it's hardly the
         ideal poster child for the British Net boom. And what makes
         that scary is that it's the only UK floated Website that
         we remember any of us actually *visiting*.

</span><span class="item">         St Patrick's Day, and a fitting time to answer a few mails
         we've had regarding the RIP Bill. Given, say our
         correspondents, the new insecurities installed into ISPs by
         the Bill would a solution be to log onto Irish ISPs, given
         their government's more enlightened approach to preserving
         privacy? Well, sadly no: thanks to a separate section of the
         same bill, the Home Secretary has the right to request mass
         monitoring of any "external communications", which is to
         say, any packet passing over UK borders. So, unless you have
         encryption on the phone line itself, this would actually
         make it *easier* to loosen your own security. However, we
         should point out that RIP might well be the perfect moment
         for Dutch or Irish entrepreneurs to introduce a Freedom
         server - which *does* provide point-to-point encryption - in
         their own country, and then charge a modest fee for UK
         users. Given that this is an area which, by RIP law, is now
         a proscribed practice in this country, feel free to take
         over this market. Emphasis on the word "free", there.

</span><span class="item">         The latest Biblical curse to hit the racks at TELEHOUSE
         EAST: showers of goo. A fault in what appears to be the fire
         supressant system means that blue glycol has been dripping
         from the ceiling onto the servers at TFM40. Fortunately, the company
         was quick to alleviate the problem - by throwing over bits
         of plastic sheeting. We should point out that 
         co-location centers other than Telehouse suffer
         problems; we only report Telehouse's because, well, they
         always seem to be more amusing. For instance: what happens

         This week, it was a $20 dollar gift voucher from Amazon,
         which guarantees our continuing use of their associate
         program in the face of the ongoing anti-patent blockade. A
         little out of character, perhaps, but easily remedied by
         *EITHER* Tim O'Reilly sending us a complimentary copy of
         Unix Power Tools, *OR* Dave Winer posting a hundred-"o"
         Cooool to his front page. Your move, compadres. But never
         let it be said that we don't stand by our principles. Danny
         *is* moving to California, albeit in pursuit of some tryst
         with a cute UI designer rather than the assassination of
         entire Wired/Lycos board of directors, as expected. Farewell
         party/lynch mob forms at the Mitre Pub, on Craven Terrace,
         near Lancaster Gate tube, London at 7pm today. Free "lucky
         dip" of his broken PDA collection for early attendees.

         guys from Northeastern Uni have a monopoly on MP3 tradez?
         Maybe: but at least their protocol is now open enough for
         other interfaces to spring up. From the grabbag sent to us
         by - oh we don't know, but his Napster handle appears to be
         y0z: the Perl module for automated searching, written by
         Lincoln "CGI.pm" Stein lets you cope with those automatic
         mass gets. NapAmp is a WinAmp plugin to save you that tiring
         Alt-Tabbing between applications. INapster lets you create a
         Web interface to RIAA's most wanted (useful for dodging
         those college firewalls). And finally, Nap, which is a text
         only interface which - unlike the others we tried - appears
         to actually work. No source though. Boo!

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MILD DISTORTION AND HEAVY FEEBDACK&gt;&gt; constituting our largest
         single-issue postbag since the time we (wrongly) claimed that
         Jamie Lee Curtis was married to John Carpenter [NTK 2000-02-
         05], thanks to the (almost 100) of you who indignantly wrote
         to say that "Joan Of Arc" was of course recorded by OMD,
         rather than Ultravox [NTK 2000-03-10] - or "fugging Ultravox
         ... FAGS" as one (anonymous) reader felt the need to clarify.
         "While the two are not always easy to distinguish," elaborated
         harvard.edu's AARON MANDEL, "I've never had a prison inmate
         call my radio show collect demanding to hear OMD, while
         Ultravox received that honor sometime last year." NTK regrets
         the error, though largely for the demographic insights it
         inadvertently provided... still on Jamie Lee Curtis, IAN
         WATTERS then accused the 'score' original soundtrack for
         Beverly Hills Cop II of being "staggeringly similar to the
         wonderful Escape From New York score", though unfortunately we
         may have to drop that thread, Ian, after an anonymous tipster
         advised "do not even think about trying to do music reviews
         again", following NTK 2000-02-04's Ultravox-heavy round-up...
         fear not, "Red Book Audio" will return when circumstances
         warrant; meanwhile, just to clear up a couple of legacy
         queries: "NICK DRAGE was not hallucinating about the Daphne
         and Celeste video," confided another anonymous source [re NTK
         2000-02-04], "it's just that after its third expected release
         they really wanted to get the video right and decided to throw
         more cash at it. Not that it came out any better", before
         going on to warn the world that Billie "is about to start
         recording her own TV show, in a similar vein to the
         'Cleopatra' one. Same production team, same crew, same
         scripts, still unfunny"... and finally, a better-than-usual
         crop of reader's MP3s arrived this month, including: Alec
         "Atari Teenage Riot" Empire meets Philip Glass on the set of
         Police Squad megamix <a href="http://www.stub.org/mix1.html">http://www.stub.org/mix1.html</a> ; comedy

         pick of the lot - if only because it follows *to the letter*
