</span><span class="item">         After months deliberating exactly how much illegal content a
         newsgroup should have before it's banned [NTK 2000-11-17],
         the INTERNET WATCH FOUNDATION has, suddenly, taken a brand
         new tack. At a board meeting this week, chair Roger
         Darlington cut through the waffle, and proposed that any
         newsgroup whose very name *sounded* illicit should be
         removed. He refused any debate on this policy, pressed for a
         vote, and won.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         And so, to celebrate the IWF's fifth birthday, an unknown
         set of newsgroups, whose crime is not to harbour illicit
         content but merely give the impression they *might*, are
         dissappearing from British spools. A little ironic birthday
         present for the IWF, an organisation that was founded to
         stop a similiar blanket blacklisting by the Metropolitan
         police back in 1997. As if by magic, IWF's board members are
         disappearing too. Malcolm Hutty, of the Campaign against
         Censorship of the Internet in Britain, quit in protest at
         the meeting. He joins Demon's representative, Clive Feather,
         who resigned in December saying - like Hutty - that he felt
         that proper scrutiny was being perceived as unhelpful by the
         organisation. Ruth Dixon, the deputy Chief Executive and one
         of the original founders, handed her notice this week too.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Left on board are the new IWF: a bloc of child protection
         experts (including John Carr, no stranger to NTK readers),
         Peter Robbins - a new CEO who is an ex-Met ex-obscene
         publications squad copper himself - and a very nervous set
         of ISP representatives, facing a coup in their own industry
         body. The new IWF, in a rather pointed press release, says
         it's seeking to increase its powers, and will be
         "repositioning" as "a body which protects children as well
         as ISPs". But what did the old IWF do? Its hotline uncovered
         thousands of illegal images, and gave the police a valuable
         data trail to track their origins - unlike the new system,
         whose bans risk simply hiding the traffic elsewhere. And
         when the transformation is complete and the newly censorious
         IWF considers banning all newsgroups containing the word
         "anime" - as one sub-committee proposal suggested, before
         Hutty squelched it - who will be around to say no? Who
         watches the Watch Foundation these days?

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         So what *would* a Usenet tyranny run by distant overlords
         who disdainfully smack down their vassal slaves be like,
         exactly? Well, look no further than uk.people.gothic. Let's
         start again. Such behaviour *is* perfectly acceptable in
         u.p.g if performed in moderation in a well-kept village
         graveyard, but one recent case has proved to be controversially
         non-consensual. Worse, it involves the dreaded intercession
         of [thunderclap on soundtrack] the UK.* USENET COMMITTEE.
         Seems some yukster noticed that the goths are lacking a
         committee-approved newsgroup charter, set about organising a
         vote to install one, as required by uk.* Usenet committee
         rules. Unfortunately, since uk.people.gothic precedes the
         creation of the omnipotent committee by some years,
         negotiating whose rules have primacy in the gothosphere
         means... well, as usual on Usenet, a massive flamewar. You
         might want to check this one out, given that it involves
         committee matters of procedure, the genteel senior citizens 
         of u.p.g. attacking the "young rebellious upstart 
         newcommers" of the committee, legalistic time-travel, Goth
         Rights, and the everpresent unspoken threat of Control, the
         uk.* Usenet committee's splendid seven foot high robot
         master. It also shows what Usenet governance is *supposed*
         to look like. Anarchic, pedantic, transparent and -
         ultimately, despite the worries - more consensual than you'd
         guess. Or, possibly, can stand.

         support when Bill Gates guests on the 200th episode... without 
         warning, Zoe Ball returns to our screens in "Friendsreunited 
         Like These" gameshow CLASS OF (9pm, Sat, BBC2), plus regularly 
         bland industry-backslapping event THE BRIT AWARDS (8pm, Thu,

         small-town puritan oppression proves no match for Kevin Bacon 
         "kicking off his Sunday shoes" in FOOTLOOSE (9.45pm, Sat, 
         BBC2) ... comedy fans are ill-served by sub-"Airplane"-style 
         spoof JANE AUSTEN'S MAFIA (11.25pm, Sat, BBC1) and recently 
         remade French time-travel slapstick LES VISITEURS (12.45am, 
         Sat, C4) ... and chances are it'll be the canned-laughter US 
         episodes of M*A*S*H (7pm, daily from Sun, Paramount Comedy 
         Channel) rather than the laughtrack-free ones the BBC used to 
         show... coinciding with the fictitious Fresh Prince's Olympic 
         disappearance from the schedules, BBC2 compensates with a UK-
         set THE REAL FRESH PRINCE (8pm, Sun, BBC2) - "I got in one 
         little fight and my mom got scared/ she said 'You're movin' 
         with your uncle and auntie in Hertfordshire'"... which handily 
         coincides with BEHIND ENEMY LINES: THE REAL CHARLOTTE GRAYS 
         (8pm, Sun, C4)... and, later in the week, The Real "Law And 
         Order: Special Victims Unit" - SEX CRIME INVESTIGATORS (9pm, 
         Thu, C4)... Michelle "Dawson's Creek" Williams blunders into 
         semi-unironic teen horror HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER (10pm, 
         Sun, C4)... SHOOTING STARS (9.30pm, Mon, BBC2) doesn't seem 
         quite as fresh as it first did all those years ago, and ditto 
         for dullsville El Mariachi remake DESPERADO (10pm, Mon, C4)... 
         though fans of the originals will still enjoy scathingly 
         accurate Wayans-brother ghetto-movie parody DON'T BE A MENACE 
         TO SOUTH CENTRAL WHILE DRINKING YOUR JUICE IN THE HOOD 
         (12midnight, Mon, C4)... in the absence of those elusive 
         remaining episodes of "Attachments", MANCHILD (10pm, Tue, 
         BBC2) is like "Sex And The City", but with unattractive 
         middle-aged men instead of women... while YOUR NHS DAY (from 
         6am, Wed, BBC1) features novel interactive options like 
         viewers being able to vote on which sympathy-evoking patient 
         should receive life-saving surgery, and which underperforming 
         hospitals should be bombed into oblivion...

         [plays] the quintessential potty-mouth in this film... and 
         potty-mouthed he was!)... while Will Smith is convincing, but 
         that "When We Were Kings" documentary is still ultimately more 
         informative than staggered-release heavyweight biographical-
         epic ALI (<a href="http://www.screenit.com/movies/2001/ali.html">http://www.screenit.com/movies/2001/ali.html</a> : 
         Bundini states that he sold Ali's championship belt for $500 
         that he then put up his arm - possibly referring to heroin; 
         the assassins who shoot and kill Malcolm X and Martin Luther 
         King obviously have extreme cases of bad attitudes; some kids 
         could be inspired to imitate Clay/Ali in and out of the ring, 
         including his verbal but humorous taunting of opponents, and 
         his religious/political stances)...
