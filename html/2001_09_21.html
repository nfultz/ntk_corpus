</span><span class="item">         MICHAEL JACKSON's new single seems likely to "Rock Your
         World" in more ways than one, as promotional copies sent out
         by Sony appear to be the first examples spotted "in the
         wild" of audio CDs which won't play in PC CD-ROM drives.
         "When loaded into the CD drive, the disc spun continuously
         as though the drive was trying to access the TOC of a blank
         or corrupted CDR", reports our correspondent, a producer and
         sound engineer, adding: "None of our stand-alone
         professional or domestic CD players had a problem with it".
         Of course, this is exactly what Macrovision's SafeAudio (or
         similar copy-protection systems) are intended to do: insert
         "bad" error-correction codes, which audio CD players can
         interpolate around, but higher-precision CD-ROM drives
         don't, effectively preventing you from ripping (or listening
         to) any tracks on your PC. The UK's Campaign for Digital
         Rights (formerly the "Free Dmitry Sklyarov" guys) are still
         planning a leafleting campaign alerting shoppers to this
         ingenious reduction of their music's self-healing properties
         (making CDs more susceptible to scratches or other damage) -
         though perhaps an "explicit lyrics"-style labelling system
         wouldn't go amiss either, for those of us who just don't own
         a non-CD-ROM CD player.

</span><span class="item">         We're all looking for safety in this insecure world: it just
         happens that some of us aren't looking very hard. Ploughing
         through the usual inbox of obscure and deliciously open
         Webservers, we were very hard pushed this week to select the
         most embarrassing lack of home security. Was it the
         university clearing service UCAS, who popped onto their
         public ftp server what appears to be a list of some three
         hundred thousand students who accepted a place at Uni this
         year (with their home addresses)? Or was it the folks at
         FORESIGHT.CO.UK, whose staging server, while ingeniously
         hidden under the <a href="http://stage.foresight.co.uk/">http://stage.foresight.co.uk/</a> URL, still
         remains publically accessible - avec private intranet - to
         the rest of the world. Or maybe, just maybe, it was ACORN
         USER, whose last CD included a free RISCOS Web Browser -
         together with the magazine's own selection of personal
         cookies, including AU reader Brian O'Carroll's Amazon
         preferences, as well as site ids for voyeurgals.com,
         amateurpie.com, and perhaps most scandalous of all for the
         true believers, MSN?

</span><span class="item">         Answering our own question: no. By tradition, all system
         weaknesses, no matter how entertaining, are always trumped
         by use of the infamous <a href="mailto:ALL@DEMON.NET">ALL@DEMON.NET</a> security hole, whereby
         company-wide Demon resignation notices always seem to get
         bounced to our tips address (what are we, Demon's secondary
         MX?). Good to see the exploit is still open, even as
         employees are *supposed* to use <a href="mailto:all@thus.net">all@thus.net</a> when firing off
         their wide-ranging, self-destructive attacks. "all@thus.net
         mailing list does not go to all staff. Hence the mail to
         all[@demon.net]", writes the resignee, before settling in
         for the argy-bargy. It's all here: the homely IRC
         references, the sideswipes at the non-Net management, the
         call to the pub, the delicious literary references. We
         eagerly await the traditional Demon management response,
         which,  judging from last time, consists of a string of
         abuse aimed at the ex-employee, followed by the swift exit
         of the manager himself. Demon: however it may change, still
         the bestest, most fun-packed of ISPs.

         to "have your picture taken with a Sun Page 3 girl", "show off
         your knowledge of the mobile communications industry" and to
         "ooh" and "ahh" at the UK's debut unveiling of MICROSOFT
         WINDOWS XP, which seems to be a long-overdue security patch
         for the popular virus-propagating operating system. We kid you
         not, last time we saw a MS product launch at one of these
         events (admittedly quite a while ago), they were facepainting
         the kids in the crowd with the "Windows" logo.

</span><span class="item">         Hack, hack, hack. X-Windows 4.0's support for antialiasing
         was a fine, timely hack by Keith Packard; rewriting
         application widget libraries like Qt and GTK 2.0 to support
         it are an ongoing piece of hackery in themselves; but in
         terms of master-kludge, shaolin philosopher Josh Parson's
         GDKXFT beats them all. It's a stomp-in replacement for the
         GTK+ font functions that lets almost all Gnome apps
         instantly fuzz over with antialiased fonts. Some fiddling is
         required: in particular, you may have to stick in a
         LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/gdkxft.so before your set-up pays any
         attention. Also it won't work with Mozilla or
         gnome-terminal, can crash your X-server, won't work with
         every font, and when you do get it working, you generally
         can't tell the difference. Which teaches you an important
         lesson: Apart from ruining GIFs in the GIMP, why did you
         want AA in the first place? Oh, yeah: hack value.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         DRESS DOWN FRIDAY&gt;&gt; sorry, no new designs this month - we're
         in the process of reworking the shop to accommodate everyone
         who's asked for everything in girls' sizes, or XXL, or black,
         or all three. Or shipped to the southern hemisphere, for that
         matter: "You're right, it's getting a bit chilly here at the
         tip of Africa - temperature's dropped to the mid-20s",
         confirmed PAUL W from his .za domain, following NTK 2001-05-
         18's jibe: "Isn't it winter over there?". "With the mercury
         hitting a dizzy 10 degrees at Bristol airport a couple of days
         ago," Paul adds, "I can appreciate your desire to hold on to
         all the T-shirts you can". More specifically, if anyone wants
         to buy any of the current range - "Encoded" now back in stock
         in both Medium and XL, "Adminspotting" back in more sizes next
         month - then do so at <a href="http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/">http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/</a> before the
         start of October, when the "changes" will commence... many
         would-be designers out there seemed to be actively encouraged
         by the "increasing trends towards the upsetting and bizarre"
         reported in NTK 2001-07-20, as ANDY PANDINI swept the board
         for worst pun of the month with his firmly non-sexist "Knead
         To Know" concept: <a href="http://www.pandini.co.uk/ntkfemale.jpg">http://www.pandini.co.uk/ntkfemale.jpg</a> - or,
         for men: <a href="http://www.pandini.co.uk/ntkmale.jpg">http://www.pandini.co.uk/ntkmale.jpg</a> . Most prolific
         was TARAS YOUNG, who submitted no less than 6 different
         designs - <a href="http://www.strugglers.net/~taras/images/shirt/">http://www.strugglers.net/~taras/images/shirt/</a> - of
         which our favourites are probably "treeloot" and "rebelgoat",
         though we're not sure if the digitised goat is a Jeff Minter
         trademark, while THE TARTARUS COLLECTIVE explored similar
         themes with their largely self-explanatory "Keep Mordor Tidy":
         <a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/things/kmt.png">http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/things/kmt.png</a> ... "Elite"
         author IAN BELL and MATTHEW GARRETT both went amazingly self-
         referential with <a href="http://www.ibell.co.uk/misc/tshirt/ntk404.htm">http://www.ibell.co.uk/misc/tshirt/ntk404.htm</a>
         and <a href="http://zeus.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~mjg59/tshirt.html">http://zeus.jesus.cam.ac.uk/~mjg59/tshirt.html</a> , and CHRIS
         HEALEY apologised for his "non-existent Paintshop skills", but
         explained that "anger got the better of me" and went ahead
         with <a href="http://www.arco.ndirect.co.uk/images/tshirt.jpg">http://www.arco.ndirect.co.uk/images/tshirt.jpg</a> anyway...
         of course, if you can't design, you can just send in a slogan
         - or, if you can't think of a slogan, you can redesign someone
         else's (we'd still like a more "visual" interpretation of last
         month's: <a href="http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/tshirt.png">http://www.tartarus.org/~simon/tshirt.png</a> ). Topping
         the text-only weirdness this time around was BODO MOELLER's
         "Personally, I prefer T-shirts with nothing printed on them.
         Consequently, I recently had myself made a couple of T-shirts
         saying 'This shirt intentionally left blank'"; the suggestion
         from JO3SH that we replace all the usual "Jesus [is Lord etc]"
         bumper stickers with "Linus" instead ("Honk if you love Linus.
         And so on"); and ALEX TEUGELS who, during the course of
         discussing whether there was a "Police Aware" complement to
         Toxico's "Police State" design, came up with the inspirational
         "Talk to the router, 'coz the host ain't listenin'". As ever,
         let us know if you could wear (or improve) any of the above,
         and we *will* get round to printing more in the future, just
         you see if we don't...
