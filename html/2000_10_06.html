           ...oh, is he disguising himself as a sweaty guy in a cheap

         the rights of man in law, then thirteen come along at once.
         Next step: enforcing a few of them online.  Coming soon:
         4DMEDIA's Chris "no, not that Chris" Morris' test case will
         investigate whether ISP's shared liability for defamatory
         Websites is a restriction on free speech. The Civil rights
         group LIBERTY is still scouting around for the perfect RIP
         test case. And we've had enquiries from Mike and Trish
         Mahoney of BLUEYONDER.COM, asking if the HRA might help them
         fend off the 18,000 e-mails and countless mis-hits they've
         received from the subscribers and staff of Telewest's
         BLUEYONDER.CO.UK. We're not sure if protection from
         "intimidation" by mistyped URLs and (in this case),
         messed-up bookmarks on Telewest's own installation CD is a
         fundamental human rights issue *per se*, but, hell, why not
         have a go? God knows, we'd like some court to decide whether
         domain names are personal property, commercial trademarks, a
         private address, the copyrighted property of Network
         Solutions, or - as some extremists claim - a mnemonic to
         remember IP numbers.

</span><span class="item">         Good to see the sickening knee-jerk liberalism is
         spreading: Russia's SUPREME COURT ruled last week that
         the security services were obliged to inform ISPs of any
         surveillance orders, as the providers were legally
         responsible for insuring the confidentiality of their
         clients' communications. Contrast with the freedom-lovin' UK,
         where telco employees get thrown in jail for five years if 
         they let anyone* know of the existence surveillance order, 
         even after its expiry date passes with no police action. That
         said, we're still lagging behind some countries on the
         technological fronts: In Malaysia, the cabinet have slapped
         a universal ban on videogames "in view of the serious
         menace" caused by the degenerate entertainment. Deputy Prime
         Minister Abdulla Badawi says the games "become like opium to
         the younger generation. They have to go and play the games
         daily or they feel uneasy when sleeping." Like any of us
         sleep anymore.

</span><span class="item">         At 23:55 on Thursday, the CGI script running KEVIN WARWICK 
         WATCH became sentient for the first time, and decided our fate 
         in a microsecond. In fact, we hadn't heard anything from the 
         UK's foremost cyber-pioneer for a couple of weeks, but he may 
         well have spent that time plotting his latest headline-
         grabbing foray into the realms of sense - and sensuality. In 
         addition to the fruition of his long-hinted plans to provide 
         himself with bat-like echolocation abilities, his new implant 
         will, via a similar device connected to his wife, relay her 
         experiences directly to him, with such perhaps-too-revealing 
         applications as "never faking an orgasm again". Full details - 
         with the exception, of course, of exactly how Kevin might 
         achieve this near-miraculous feat of neurological wiring - 
         appear on the main KWW page, under the headings "Technology

</span><span class="item">         Yes, approximately 97% of NTK-featured events take place in
         either London or California, but there's just something about
         those two venues that seems to actively invite our heartless
         mockery. Fortunately other regions have been getting in on the
         act recently, thanks to the touring efforts of cod-corporate
         "edutainments" like BBC FUTUREWORLD, drawn to our attention by
         reader DAVID DEANS, and enthralling the inhabitants of both
         Bristol and Portsmouth until at least the end of October.
         Leading one to suspect that they comprise bits of stuff that
         were part of a failed Millennium Dome bid, Deans reports that
         the exhibitions are "run by some odd part of the BBC which
         tells us how excellent it is", as well as heavily sponsored by
         BT. Attractions (at the Bristol one at least) include free
         admission, a manga Peter Snow, endless digital TV propaganda,
         and trying to view pr0n on the inadequately firewalled PCs.
         "Crap," Deans concludes, "but in a cool-spazz0 sort of a way."

         right. The smug answer comes courtesy of, you'll be pleased
         to hear, an obscure telephony standards initiative. OPENH323 
         is a set of drivers supporting the ITU's videoconferencing 
         protocol, which just happens to be the same standard used by
         Microsoft's Netmeeting. The 1.1 version has just slipped out
         of beta. The whole thing is a bit of a beast to install, and
         not quite past the "hello? helloooo?" stage, but then what
         Internet telephone isn't? Video4Linux and FreeBSD
         videograbbers are supported. Confirm that those conference
         calls aren't worth your precious time today!

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CONFECTIONERY THEORY&gt;&gt; a mixed verdict on this month's major
         arrival, the CADBURY'S SNOWFLAKE: DERYCK RAWLINGS reported
         that, although white chocolate gives him migraines, his "young
         lady" pronounced it "absolutely yummy", enabling Cadbury to
         "regain my favour after the Shush disappointment"... "white
         choc doesn't taste of anything," analysed trainee chemist TOM
         ANDERSON: "[Snowflake] also lacks the top-drawer chocolate
         that makes this architecture work for Ripple", while adding "a
         truly alarming cross-sectional appearance" and a "nasty
         aftertaste" which he promised to investigate using his gas
         chromatograph... so the casting vote goes to SIMON GREENWOOD,
         who persuasively argued: "There is a vague delineation between
         the white and milk chocolate but [the bars] are made all the
         more delicious by the spectacle of the airhead Turner and her
         new hubby [appearing in] such a crappy picture"... on the
         import front, the ground-breaking <a href="http://www.cybercandy.co.uk">http://www.cybercandy.co.uk</a>
         crew have now added New Zealand, Japanese and Chinese faves to
         their line-up, as well as US classics such as ThinkGeek-style
         PENGUIN CAFFEINATED PEPPERMINTS (UKP2.65, also available in
         "Decaff" form). Kiwis specialise in choc-covered marshmallow
         bars - as with CADBURY'S PINKY (UKP1.20, pink marshmallow),
         CADBURY'S CHOCOLATE FISH (69p, also pink), and PASCALL'S
         PINEAPPLE LUMPS (UKP2.45, pineapple flavoured, yellow) - while
         the ever-expanding Japanese range includes such beautifully
         packaged delights as MEIJI CHOCO BABY (UKP1.45 - normal or
         strawberry varieties) and LOTTE CHOCOLATE SNACK KOALAS
         (UKP1.89, empty box makes excellent desk-ornament), as well as
         the inevitable taste-surprises like CHELSEA YOGURT SCOTCH
         (UKP1.37, boiled sweets with "The Taste of Old Scotland"), and
         HI-SOFT GREEN TEA flavoured toffees (UKP1.23)... reassuringly,
         our UK sweet-industry seems to be more than holding its own,
         as DAVID CHALLENDER alerted us to "the ice cream version of
         those green triangle chocs found in Quality Street"; DAN
         CALLADINE unilaterally awarded new FOX'S JAM 'N' CREAM ROCKY
         BISCUITS the prized plaudit of "nicest Rocky ever"; and WAYNE
         WILLIAMS enthused over KELLOGG'S TOFFEE FROSTIES, the "coming
         soon" NUTRIGRAIN ELEVENSES ("am incredibly excited by the
         prospect of being able to replace all my meals with small
         chewy bars") and, inexplicably, WESTLIFE BUBBLEGUM, "spotted
         at a service station on the M6"... great work team - your
         targets for this month include CADBURY'S TANGO CRUNCHIE (rrp
         35p), MARS' "WHO NICKED THE NOUGAT?" LIMITED EDITION SNICKERS
         and, leaked to us from a Mars secret test-site, SKITTLES MINTS
