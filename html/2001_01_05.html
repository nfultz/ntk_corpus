         as the human brain. We've passed that now. BT tried to
         explore whether there was any danger of consciousness

</span><span class="item">         We all love Christmas and New Year - because everyone takes
         a week off work to spend time with their friends and
         families, and all the hacked and broken websites get to
         stay up just that little bit longer. GRANADA-TV.CO.UK's
         Apache server was radically misconfigured for at least 4
         days (until yesterday), generously serving password files to
         casual Crack users hoping to obtain logins for "This
         Morning" and "Emmerdale" ("woolsack" and "tmo", you slack
         Granada sysadmins, you). REGISTER readers were assured that
         the defacing of BA's GO-FLY.COM did not put customer data at
         risk; shadowy security vigilantes THE DATA NETWORK SECURITY
         COUNCIL begged to differ, pointing out that go-fly's
         webserver still appeared to be exploitable via script kiddy
         favourite Remote Data Services - "with full read/write
         privileges". And finally, another seasonal shopper claimed
         that placing an order at SERVICESALES.SEL.SONY.COM "lists
         the encryption key and output file name (placed under
         /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs.service/service/temp/temp[order#].
         txt.asc)" - though, to throw those wily haxxors off the
         scent, "that line is generated using a white font so it
         can't be seen. It shows up if you highlight it, though."
         Start as you mean to go on, folks. Start as you mean to go on.

         week but predictable profit warnings, Mac panic price-cuts
         and almost-in-accordance-with-prophecy kernel releases. And
         so we return to the perennial mysteries, such as: what is it
         *really* like at Menwith Hill? Thanks to the ongoing

         Wiccan-oriented guide to relocating there for the American
         military. Common prejudice regarding pagans (to wit: lovely
         gentle folk who you still never ever want to see skyclad,
         ta) are somewhat undone here by the whole "running the
         bizarre protestor lady over" thought-experiment in this
         guide. That lady is, of course, Lindis Percy, winner of the
         1998 "Winston" Big Brother Award for her monitoring of the
         monitoring station, and one of the few people to commit a
         successful private prosecution against a military police
         officer. And we're still not sure where the "do no harm" bit
         lies here: but, hell, if you had the chance to conduct a

         had problems cataloguing the massive publicity onslaught
         mounted by KEVIN WARWICK over the holidays. Capitalising on
         the apparent kudos of his Royal Institution lectures, Kev went
         on to appear in yesterday's Sun, explaining how his "robot
         that runs away when anybody in the laboratory tries to switch
         it off" is merely the vanguard of "more powerful machines"
         which we "will have no option but to obey". His mission to
         warn and inform continues next Wednesday 2001-01-10 at IT-in-
         education trade show BETT 2001, with his touring crowd-pleaser
         "Will it be Super Intelligent Machines or Cyborgs?". Spotter
         OPERATIVE IAN seemed oddly reassured that "under 18's will not
         be admitted" to the show, and that cybersex pioneer Kevin will
         not be involved in teaching "the facts of life".

         office SGI, revelling in CHRIS PIRAZZI's amazing 1995 live
         video-&gt;ascii art convertor. Well, now you too can pray that
         such fripperies don't lead your company to inevitable
         stagnation and collapse, when you too compile your own copy
         of HASCIICAM for Video4Linux. Features include dumping in
         VT100 friendly spools (for live telecasts via telnet) or
         automatic HTML generation for counterintuitively large
         Webcam uploads. Now it's just a matter of selling banner-ad
         space on your "Am I Naked In This Text Dump Or Not" Website,
         and you'll have it all.

         end-of-year quiz this time, but we thought we'd make up for it

         minor) technical inaccuracies that you could write in about -
         to win nothing but the approval of your peers and, of course,
         NTK's everlasting gratitude... when we described the movie
         "Aces High" as a "WW2-er" [NTK 2000-11-17], DISCO DAVE hit
         back with "Strange old bi-planes they had in WW2, eh?"... when
         we hypothesised that Dudley Moore's last ever TV appearance
         [NTK 2000-12-01] might be an "unusually cruel Peter Cook
         prank", MICHAEL WALSH felt duty-bound to point out that it
         would be "unusually weird, too, as Peter Cook himself has been
         dead for some time"... *and* we almost entirely misunderstood
         the mechanics of LASTMINUTE's share dilution [NTK 2000-11-24],
         the real details of which are too staggeringly dull for even
         us to go into here... DAVID MADISON semi-defended The Onion's

         of which were "scheduled to be 'retired'" by the end of last
         year... and finally, DOUGLAS HOLLANDS gave the most plausible
         explanation for Stephen Hawking's mysterious injuries [NTK
         2000-11-17], citing <a href="http://www.mchawking.com">http://www.mchawking.com</a> to posit "Perhaps
