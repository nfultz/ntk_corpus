         DTI deadline might sound like an odd time to launch your
         commercial Trusted Third Party crypto service, but the
         ROYAL MAIL seem pretty convinced that the DTI won't bring back 
         that key escrow requirement ("they see each other at a lot of
         conferences"). Then again, though they're not hoarding keys 
         themselves, their site makes some faintly escrow-like claims 
         ("Key backup and recovery is a straight forward commercial 
         necessity" - ViaCode FAQ) which may be fine for businesses, but 
         tricky to establish as a widely used standard. The Royal Mail
         is controlled by the DTI, so maybe it's a stealthy back-door
         attempt to convince the companies of Britain that hey, it's
         *cool* to expose your privates...

         before leaving the company, naming one of them as "a tosser".
         Then, as NTK went to press last week, news arrived that Roy

         1999-03-20, "Open" Club, Charing Cross Rd, London, UKP3). It's
         either an elaborately overblown promotional event for the
         launch of Nettime compendium book README: ASCII CULTURE AND
         THE REVENGE OF KNOWLEDGE (nice self-parodic title), a genuine
         "post-media flea-market", or - yet more terrifyingly - both.
         The list of attendees literally redefines the phrase "usual
         suspects", like some nightmarish ICA outreach program, but if
         even the GameBoy hacking turns out to be a disappointment,
         it's not far from the representatively small-scale SMALL PRESS
         FAIR (10am-5.30pm, Sat 1999-03-20, Waterloo Foyer, South Bank
         Centre, London, free), so you needn't waste the whole day.

</span><span class="item">         Despite the "wearable" hypola that's funding it, MIT Media
         Lab's REMEMBRANCE AGENT is a near-stable, usable, unobtrusive
         background altavista of local files for Emacs users who've
         swapped out their own long-term memory to cope with all those
         key combos. You type away in one Emacs window; it throws up an
         ongoing hitlist of relevant mail or plaintext files it's
         uncovered in the other. Some understandable downsides, but
         refresh-hungry largish indexes, semi-random ordering of hits,
         lag, and an overly literal attitude only mildly detract from
         RA's overall coolness. Non-emaxen may enjoy writing their own
         front-end to the straightforward search engine. But then
         again, if you enjoy that, you really should be using Emacs
         anyway.

         really deserves a little section all of its own. TV GO HOME is
         Britain's premier offensive TV listings page, updated
         fortnightly, hosted by us, compiled by, uh, one of NTK's
         favourite humourists - and anyone else furious about the so-
         called prime-time schedules. ITV's the next target but, for
         the moment, "feel free to download and attach to emails for
         pals", advises our anonymous anti-telly activist.

         for either ANOTHER 48 HOURS (10.30pm, Fri, BBC1) or hoop
         dreamer BLUE CHIPS (12midnight, Fri, BBC1) - the latter
         amusingly credited to one "Nicky Nolte" by the Radio Times...
         following their crystal-clear explanation of PGP on Wed,
         NEWSNIGHT (10.30pm, Fri, BBC1) takes on The Webbies... and XX-
         chromo comedy SMACK THE PONY (9.30pm, Fri, C4) could be just
         the lame sketch show that the Sally Phillips fan page has been
         waiting for <a href="http://www.w2s.net/sally-phillips/">http://www.w2s.net/sally-phillips/</a> ... a female
         onslaught of another kind in SPECIES (10pm, Sat, ITV) -
         swiftly tracked by the empathic skills of super-sensitive
         "Waiting To Exhale" director Forest Whitaker... John Peel
         unlikely to question that "I build my own synths" nonsense on
         his visit to Cornwall's Aphex Twin in SOUND OF THE SUBURBS
         (12.20am, Sat, C4)... while BBC2 follows "Vegas Evening" and
         "Bridget Jones Night" with a special racism season, including
         nu-skool breakdancing fave LA HAINE (11.25pm, Sat, BBC2)...
         Sunday morning hots up with not even NTK's own Danny O'Brien
         daring to go head-to-head against new 10-part LEE AND
         HERRING'S THIS MORNING WITH RICHARD NOT JUDY (12.15pm, Sun,
         BBC2) - now Rod Hull-sketch free... and relocated to Glasgow,
         the live-action G FORCE (11.20am, Sun, BBC2) retains few
         elements of the animated Battle Of The Planets original...
         noted trash connoisseur Jonathan Ross takes the chair at FILM
         99 (10.15pm, Sun Oscar Preview; 10.55pm, Wed, BBC1) - can't
         wait for the quotes on movie posters: "FWILLING: A NON-STOP
         WOALA-COASTA WIDE" - BBC Film 99... SEINFELD bows out with
         another bitterness-fuelled clip show (10pm, Mon, SkyOne)...
         the BBC gets the cost-cutting idea, with Alexei Sayle
         introducing a "War" comedy compilation in YOU CANNOT BE
         SERIOUS (9.30pm, Mon, BBC2) plus Julie Walters hosting THE
         STORY OF THE BRITISH SITCOM (10pm, Wed, BBC1)... and John Woo
         blows up every helicopter in sight in semi-smug Travolta/
         Slater chaser BROKEN ARROW (9pm, Tue, C5)... JD Salinger fails
         to explain why Catcher In The Rye is the lone assassin's read
         of choice in CLOSE UP (9.30pm, Tue, BBC2)... music soothes an
         autistic child in YOUNG MUSICIANS (11.15pm, Wed, BBC2) - we
         don't mean by obsessively cataloguing his record collection...
         and, disappointingly, weird CGI live-action MYSTIC KNIGHTS OF
         TIR NA NOG (Fri,16:30,ITV) does not appear to be based around
         the ZX Spectrum game of the same name...

         Father Ted frolic WAKING NED (MPAA: PG for mild nudity,
         language and thematic elements) highlights an alarming new
         trend in removing surnames from the titles of UK releases -
         see also the upcoming MIGHTY JOE (nee YOUNG). Extending this
         to other films, "Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom" becomes
         "Indiana And The Temple Of Doom", "Saving Private Ryan"
         becomes "Saving Private", "Jerry Maguire" becomes the Seinfeld-
         esque "Jerry", and "Sommersby" becomes simply "_________"...
         still, if you like 'em dumb, they don't come any dumber than
         dedicated disco loser comedy A NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY (imdb:
         based-on-tv-series / saturday-night-live) - Chazz Palminteri

         Whether Robbins Is A Mad Secret Terrorist Psycho-Bomber in

         7.99, Amazon 6.39) comes on like Junior Dune vs M Banks' Use

         FROM THE OPEN SOURCE REVOLUTION (RRP 16.50, Amazon 13.20)
         is to watch the usual gurus compete in politically-correct
         licensing conditions on the frontispiece. Downhill after that,
         with reprints and rehashed arguments: Paul Vixie injects some
         engineering sense, and Stallman's piece stands out as a
         graceful polemic - but then you can get that at

         sadly, for the majority of TREKS NOT TAKEN (RRP 6.99, Amazon

         from the only 20something in Britain who never says "fuck"...
         much better '80s nostalgia 'n' attitude from Julie Burchill's
         paperback borderline-coherent bio I KNEW I WAS RIGHT (RRP

         to Onion compilation OUR DUMB CENTURY (RRP 9.17, Amazon

         Powerbook-powered "spiritual oddyssey" RUNNING TO THE MOUNTAIN
         (RRP 12.23, Amazon 11.01)... or Bill Gates' hack futurism
         BUSINESS AT THE SPEED OF THOUGHT (RRP 18.99, Amazon 15.19) - a
         subtle allusion to the 1987 Ultramagentic MC's track,
         "Traveling At the Speed of Thought", perhaps? Well, perhaps
