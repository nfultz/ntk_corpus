</span><span class="item">         What is it with April? Is it some ancient hormonal trigger,
         that causes grown men and women to become flitty, and
         gallivant from one job to another? Or is it just that it's
         the start of a new financial year, and they're shifting
         before they get sacked? In such matters, science cannot
         inform, merely record. MARK "only half decent person there"
         FROST from BBC Online has wandered off to CAPITAL (Britain's
         most commercially-driven yet curiously limpid Website). In
         an unrelated move, JULIAN HARDY from Capital's running off
         to IPC. Less parochially, KAI KRAUSE morphed seamlessly from
         founder/chief design officer of METATOOLS to "that guy who
         used to work here". And HAKON WIUM LIE (whose name is pidgin
         english for his old job: inventing and hacking those
         dastardly cascading style sheets) left the W3C. Now he's
         back in his home country of Norway as the new CTO for OPERA
         SOFTWARE. Okay, okay, it's not quite Marc Andreessen and
         Netscape all over again, but at least Hakon'll ensure that
         one browser will implement CSSs correctly. And, believe us,
         that's as exciting as the Web gets these days. Yes, you did
         choose the wrong career. Go back to that rock and roll band.

</span><span class="item">         You can always tell when a company is thinking of going
         public, because suddenly its product turns to cack. Well,
         FREESERVE appears to be hitting that scalability wall with
         1.5 million customers (our favourite omen: some customers
         have been dialling into the service, only to find themselves
         at a admin router prompt instead). So it's a great relief
         that all these other freewheeling ISPs are there to take up
         the slack. Including, of course, Demon's new In2Home
         service. Except it actually belongs to Scottish Telecom,
         Demon's evil sibling company, who apparently didn't tell
         Scottish Power (parent of both) about the free service until
         just before they were about to launch it. Which meant that
         when Power did find out, and insisted that Demon got
         involved too, the poor guys only had two weeks to work out
         what the hell was going on. Meanwhile, everyone's still
         looking curiously at Easynet, and wondering - when will the
         final shoe drop?

</span><span class="item">         It's a weird war that sees us siding with Wired (over a
         copyright issue!), but Brit-based "contemporary NewzFeed"
         NINFOMANIA seems to be dropping its habit of mailing its
         subscribers word-for-word transcripts from wired.com, with
         maybe an extra introductory paragraph and a cheeky "(c)
         Wired Nuwz" at the end. Obviously this would be of little
         interest to anyone who doesn't subscribe to the Ninfo
         mailing list (we read it so you don't have to), except they
         claim to be planning a "complete archive" of past issues on
         their site, intriguingly duplicating the efforts of some of
         the original publishers, who have their own archives in
         out-of-the-way little places like wired.com, cnet.com, and
         The Onion...

         sympathise with the plight of KOSOVO REFUGEES - though of
         course Club 247's Charity Weekender site provides a more
         tasteful, humanitarian rationale. From next Fri-Sun (1999-04-
         23 to 04-25), the plan is that participating clubs will
         donate UKP1 per punter to the Kosovo Crisis Appeal - there's
         still time to get involved, though they probably don't want
         you to organise local collections of used clubwear and dodgy
         E's. We wouldn't normally feature club events in NTK (it's
         all bang bang bang and you can't concentrate properly on the
         PlayStations), but it's a good cause, and, on balance, less

         Ahem. Nonetheless, C2.NET (a company that's *so* a front for
         Neal Stephenson's "Secret Admirers" cabal) would like to
         speak to you about a job they need filling. You might get
         along - last time we met one of their senior staff, he was
         setting fire to a 2KG lump of magnesium in the middle of the
         desert. The guys in the UK branch (who are a little calmer,
         we understand) are looking for a C programmer with
         experience in cryptographic implementations to work on their
         Apache and OpenSSL development. Applications along the lines
         of "I have encoded my CV indetectably within the
         packet-number sequence of this SMTP session" will be
         admired, but won't get you a second interview. US citizens
         may not apply for this job, as apparently your brains count
         as munitions.

         to be the only reminder service in the world." Yes, but what
         if it *wasn't*? What if there were thousands of them, each
         with their own clunky interface? Wouldn't you be tempted to
         make your own too, out of bits of Web you found lying
         around? Why not set up a cronjob to call the telephone call
         back demo form at <a href="http://www.realcall.net/index2.ihtml">http://www.realcall.net/index2.ihtml</a> with
         your own phone number whenever you need a reminder? You'd
         never need to use BT's hideously expensive AlarmCall service
         again - plus you'd have the pleasure of explaining to a
         telesales operator that you didn't want to buy their product,
         - but thanks for waking you up anyway.

         <a href="http://www.nick.com/docs/tv_shows/p150t1c1.html">http://www.nick.com/docs/tv_shows/p150t1c1.html</a> upped the
         stakes but the dumb toy parodies always were the weakest bits
         of THE ADAM AND JOE SHOW (11.10pm, Fri, C4)... an unexpectedly
         short run for Julian Clary's Mr And Mrs, swiftly replaced this
         week by sodding HOLIDAYS FROM HELL (10pm, Fri, ITV)... and
         yes, you do remember seeing a younger version of celeb-spotter
         THE WAY THEY WERE (9pm, Sat, ITV) on the BBC a while back,
         called "Before They Were Famous"... apparently without
         provocation, former music list TOP TEN (9.30pm, Sat, C4) veers
         dramatically off the rails and starts covering political
         scandals - other pop shows take note... following the bizarre
         spectacle of BBC1's "Red Hair Day" [NTK 1997-12-05], C5's
         BLONDE WEEKEND (from 11pm, Sat, C5) tosses its golden locks
         with Pamela Anderson mind-swapping sci-erotica NAKED SOULS -
         yet horrifyingly includes Rutger Hauer's parallel universe
         Aryan thriller FATHERLAND (9pm, Sun, C5)... plus, if anyone
         could make a slapstick comedy out of "Fantastic Voyage", it's
         Joe Dante - as INNERSPACE (2.55pm, Sun, BBC1) aptly proves...
         among the meat-free performers at A CONCERT FOR LINDA
         MCCARTNEY (10.30pm, Sun, BBC1) are Ladysmith Black Mambazo -
         advertisers of veggie staple Heinz Beans... you can bet they
         scanned the film for radiation-induced "fogging" when DISASTER
         (8pm, Mon, BBC2) shot an episode inside the accident-prone
         reactor at Windscale... and sure, "Mars Needs Women" '60s sci-
         fi THE NIGHT CALLER (2am, Mon, ITV) sounds nutty, but it's got
         to be more fun than SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE (10pm, Mon, C4) -
         which, 10 years on, we'd still rather see as a headline pun
         than as a film... despite constant stunt-casting, and a script
         from the "Invasion Earth" bloke, we'll rather miss THE
         GRIMLEYS (10.30pm, Mon &amp; Tue, ITV)... hmm, must remember not
         to call CGI art slot ONE.ZERO (12.05am, Tue, C4) "the usual
         blurry nonsense"... the web-porn plot hots up in newly re-
         theme-tuned NEIGHBOURS (1.40pm, Mon-Fri, BBC1)... and Knight
         Rider turbo-boosts off into the sunset, leaving C5's 7pm slot
         to trash gameshows and genius Naked Gun prequel series POLICE
         SQUAD (7pm, Wed, C5). Sadly, there's only 6 episodes, and the
         middle 4 are patchy to say the least - "We would have come
         earlier, but your husband wasn't dead then"...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; after the hilarity of last week's The Faculty, another
         good week for New Geek Cinema, with masturbation, obscene
         calls, and Twin Peaks' lovely Lara Flynn Boyle contributing to
         Todd Solondz's ultra-dark disturbo-fest HAPPINESS (imdb: black-
         comedy) - currently on London-only release (yes, provinces,
         that's how disturbing it is), and not, it appears, based
         around the Ken Dodd song of the same name... stock market
         social satire AN IDEAL HUSBAND (imdb: based-on-play) is as
         relevant now as beautiful ladies and gentlemen swanning around
         in evening dress ever was; Oscar Wilde may be witty, but he's
         no Kevin Williamson... and finally: "Swingers' Vince Vaughn,
         swingin' Anne Heche put real take on Prisoner's Dilemma game
         theory" was what we said last time RETURN TO PARADISE (imdb:
         drama / romance / thriller) was due for release last November,
         and we see no reason to change our story now...
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         BEST BEFORE BUYS&gt;&gt; CADBURY'S rumoured to be introducing both a
         pre-packed FLAKE '99 CONE (99p) plus ENVY (99p): an "adult
         indulgent product" (half-Magnum, half-Feast) designed to
         tackle consumer objections that "other stick products are just
         too big"... no kidding: violating nature's law that two
         objects cannot occupy the same physical space (q.v. "The
         Fly"), WALL'S MAGNUM DOUBLE (UKP1) is a slightly smaller
         vanilla-choc Magnum that's teleported *inside* another,
         slightly larger Magnum. Cumulative effect revolting...
         "Innocent on the outside, Wicked on the inside" proclaims
         NESTLE MEGA TRUFFLE (UKP1), fair warning that the "sumptuous"
         orange liqueur ice-cream "hidden inside" is evilly repellent.
         Maybe it's that lesser-known use of the word "sumptuous" -
         meaning "of, or resembling, a sump"... MAGNUM CLASSIC CONE
         (UKP1) ain't so bad if it's nut-free Cornetto you're looking
         for, though Nestle have the edge here with the choc-vanilla 2-
         scoop EXTREME DUO (UKP1; sounds like a superhero tie-in,
         isn't), the frankly self-explanatory TOFFEE CRISP (65p), and
         the bizarrely continental MAXIBON (80p) - a lolly/choc-ice
         hybrid where you actually *eat the stick*. Well, the "Two soft
         cookies, half dipped in milk", to be precise... fruit-ice (and
         adulterants) round-up next time; still with chocs, this
         month's "taste abomination" goes to JAFFA CAKE FLAVOUR FRIJJ
         (79p) <a href="http://www.frijj.com/specials.htm">http://www.frijj.com/specials.htm</a> - "the bitterest
         milkshake experience yet!", our taster reports. "If this was
         the best to come out of DairyCrest labs, the rest must have
         been so *vile* they had to be tracked down and destroyed by
         Michael Madsen"... surprisingly, "Cheesy Grin" flavour WALKERS
         SUN DOG SAVOURY POPCORN (99p reduced to 59p for giant 100g
         bag; small packs 15p) isn't bad at all - well, not after the
         first few startling mouthfuls... and finally, a universally
         sticky thumbs-up from NTK readers for NESTLE KITKAT CHUNKY (30-
         35p), vividly described by Mathew "Kuji" Bevan ("The Biggest
         Threat To World Peace Since Adolf Hitler") as "Yum Yum...
         Single finger of kit-kat with elephantitis... Lots of choccie,
         quite a generous amount... not bad... v.nice". Inexplicably,
         we received this email more than 5 times, creating the
         alarming impression that Mat was chomping through a box of
         them, Cookie Monster-style, eliciting *exactly the same
         comment each time*...
