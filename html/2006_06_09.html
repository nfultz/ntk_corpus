</span><span class="item">         Understandably overlooked in the recent furore over John 
         Prescott's "grace and favour" extravagances: the near-250K 
         dropped by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in 2004 to 
         help fund MySociety, the UK's premier purchaser of web domains 
         consisting of combinations of the words "Them/ They", "Write", 
         "Work", "For", "To" and "You". Apparently, they've got "a 
         little bit" of that (among other) cash left over, and are 
         therefore once again calling for proposals for projects that 
         are "Founded on electronic networks", have a "Real world 
         impact on democratic and community aspects of people's lives", 
         and "Low or zero cost scalability", which ought to narrow it 
         down from your usual late-night rambles about "LazyWebs". 
         There isn't actually a disclaimer to this effect, but we 
         suspect that, by entering, you're kind of waiving any personal 
         ownership of your idea - and we don't think the "winner" 
         actually gets any of the money themselves (unless they 
         subsequently persuade MySociety to employ them as some sort of 
         specialist contractor, which - by our limited understanding - 
         is sometimes what spending public money is all about).

         the matches will be temporarily transformed into temperate 
         sanctuaries of calm and contemplation, where one can sit in a 
         quiet corner with a cold glass of "Turbo Shandy", thoughtfully 
         inscribing pencil notes in the margins of an O'Reilly manual 
         or two. Or, if you like things a little livelier, there's also 
         next Sat's @MEDIA SOCIAL (from 1pm, Sat 2006-06-17, The Livery 
         Bar, 130 Wood Street, nr St Paul's, London EC2V 6DL, free but 
         buy your own drinks and food) - a fringe event to this week's 
         @Media web design conference, and featuring a "best of" lineup 
         from this year's London Geek Dinners, including Molly "Web 
         Standards Project" Holzschlag and Dave "CSS Zen Garden" Shea. 
         Specific get-togethers are scheduled for particular fields 
         (2pm CSS, 3pm Accessibility, 4pm JavaScript etc) during the 
         afternoon, a thoroughly civilised arrangement which bodes 
         somewhat better than some "fringe" events we've been to 
         recently, not least because they've relaxed that usual daft 
         "Geek Dinner" criterion of having to pay in advance for a 
         variable-quality pub buffet.

         We can't imagine there's a day when Christophe Grenier isn't 
         swathed by offers of beers, steak dinners and marriage for 
         TESTDISK and PHOTOREC, his two open source disk and file 
         recovery utilities. The test TestDisk gives is sort of a final 
         exam for your futzed partition block, quizzing your unreadable 
         drive for tell-tale NTFS, HFS+, Ext3 or what-have-you data, 
         and cribbing the lost partition data from what it finds. 
         PHOTOREC gives up on such fripperies as a filing system and 
         instead grubs directly on the drive for file data, spotting 
         beginnings for popular file formats and having a stab at where 
         their ends might be hanging. PHOTOREC, as the name suggests, 
         started as a utility for clawing back pictures from bit-rotten 
         flash cards, but can now sniff out files from Ogg Vorbis to 
         Microsoft Powerpoint. Both utilities will run on Mac, DOs, 
         Windows, Linux, and probably vegetable oil for that matter. 
         Forget about them for now - when you need them, you'll find 
         them.

         the imminent second season of Robbie Coltrane psycho-profiling 
         classic CRACKER (11pm, Thu, ITV3)...

         overuse of "H128" in Irwin Allen's "City Beneath The Sea" 
         (almost every minute at around 0:45, peaking at once every 10-

         Pertwee was the Doctor he was stranded on a planet along with 
         some Daleks and humans [...] in search of some magic element
