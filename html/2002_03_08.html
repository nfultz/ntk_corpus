</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         To the BIG BROTHER AWARDS: traditionally a bit of a friendly
         get-together for those who fight for personal privacy while
         desperately attempting to get "monitored" by the press doing
         so. This year, however, saw a bit of extremist entryism -
         principally in the form of those chubby young men in their
         uncomfortable suits, the Orthodox Libertarians. And, on
         discovering that everyone else wasn't quite the government
         lickspittles the pamphlets implied, how pleased they were!
         Seeing both Mark Thomas and the Telegraph editorial team
         join forces to protest the government's recent invasive
         policies, they fell to their knees and thanked the gods of
         Critical Rationality that everyone had promptly united
         behind the libertarian cause. "Could they possibly come to
         any conclusion other than the ownership of self and the
         sovereignty of the individual?", marvelled the Libertarian
         Alliance's David Carr looking with new eyes upon those who
         he had previously dismissed as "wall-to-wall dreadlocks".
         Well, we'd have asked them all down the pub after the
         ceremony, but what with David Shayler getting pied by a
         bunch of anarchists and someone else throwing a pint over
         the Telegraph's Deputy Ed, it was a little tricky to ask how
         they'd all managed to put aside their differences. Still,
         nice to see those unidealistic libertarians as grounded in
         the real world as ever.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         "I wonder if the average NTK reader thinks as highly of
         .name as I do?", writes - well, somebody. Putting aside the
         truth that there are no "average" readers, only less extreme
         outliers, we certainly believe that they do. It is, after
         all, a silly domain. Any single-issue TLD is going to get
         trashed sooner or later, unless they're really careful with
         the nominees. And so desperate are all the registrars to
         make a buck, that just isn't going to happen. And, as if to
         prove us right, the Hithertofore Nameless One continues:
         "Well, I've registered a .name which I felt conveyed my
         feelings. If anyone wants to share and have their own free
         subdomain under bork.bork.bork.name, they can", says the
         subscriber, who we'll call Judge Bork, "provided they a)
         email <a href="mailto:hostmaster@bork.bork.bork.name">hostmaster@bork.bork.bork.name</a> with their nameserver
         IP numbers and subdomain request and b) it's amusing
         enough". So there you are. Pollute the namespace: It'll
         annoy Esther Dyson, and make Vernor Vinge's "True Names"
         look a bit silly (although we still believe Mr Vinge was
         predicting IRC 'nicks', not the global DNS framework)._

         performance by Robin "Scanner" Rimbaud, that Linklater
         rotoscope movie, Star Wars parody films - and NTK's very own
         DIY web-publishing workshop, currently scheduled for 6pm at
         the Redundant Technology Initiative's "Access Space" HQ on Fri
         2002-03-15. But we're not listed on the Lovebytes site at the

         "Database Nation", exemplary risks journalist and ex-NeXT
         hacker, is sneakily previewing the next incarnation of his
         decade-old address book applet SBOOK - now up to version 5,
         and ported via metempsychosis to the Mac OS X platform. It's
         a sweet little program which looks innocently like one of
         those freeform cardfile databases, but hides terrifying
         "proprietary search techniques" and sinister "artificial
         intelligence" to allow speedier monitoring of all your
         victim's names and addresses. Have a file on everyone! Dial
         their number using the internal modem! Send them blackmail
         letters using the "print envelope" functionality!

         has caved to our thinly-veiled threats of NTK 2002-01-25, and
         non-US citizens can now buy a <a href="http://www.ntkmart.com/">http://www.ntkmart.com/</a> t-shirt
         on their credit cards without having to sign up for a full
         PayPal account. Prices are still in dollars (hey, it's good
         practice for converting everything into Euros) - and thanks to
         everyone who alerted us to <a href="http://www.paypalsucks.com/">http://www.paypalsucks.com/</a> and the
         like, which appear to primarily document the claims of users
         who naively allowed thousands of dollars to accumulate in
         their PayPal accounts. Our tip: don't do that then... new this
         month is the "404 /SHIRT/TIE: NOT FOUND" design submitted by
         reader CAMILO MESIAS back in NTK 2001-12-07, and a (slightly)
         less sexist variation of DAVID J BODYCOMBE's "Hi-Score Table"
         idea <a href="http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/hiscoresf.gif">http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/hiscoresf.gif</a> which has
         been kicking around since NTK 2001-08-24. Both receive at
         least UKP2 per shirt sold (Bodycombe quite a bit more in fact
         because he funded this new design from royalties from the
         "Encoded" one which he co-designed and which will be back in
         stock real soon now)... the latest runners-up include PAUL
         COOPER's "IANAL" (prone to misinterpretation), JEREMY ARDLEY's
         "b4 i gt my pHn / i cdnt evN Spll / DslXc Mrn / nw IR1" (a bit
         harsh towards dyslexics, we felt), PAUL RANDALL's copyright-
         infringing <a href="http://www.darkwave.org.uk/~gribbley/gauntlet.txt">http://www.darkwave.org.uk/~gribbley/gauntlet.txt</a> ,

         these kinds of shirts yet, but when we do)... though we were
         quite tempted by JAMES SWIFT's currently embryonic suggestions
         of <a href="http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/jamesswift1.gif">http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/jamesswift1.gif</a> and

         might go quite nicely with a "Fly al-Qaeda" slogan if anyone
         out there is any good at designing fake airline logos. And
         we'd still like to see some parodies of the classic Designer's
         Republic "look": <a href="http://www.thepeoplesbureau.com/">http://www.thepeoplesbureau.com/</a> - rather
         than, say, IAN STUART's elaborate spoofs of our current range:

         not much action at the moment in the parallel "Buy One,
         Subvert The Mass Media, Get One Free" competition, as NTK's
         own Dave Green continues to plough his own lonely digital-TV
         furrow: <a href="http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/">http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/</a> , although ALASTAIR
         ALEXANDER did spot someone in an "I Got 80million" shirt at a
         recent London Fetish Fair, but was unable to supply evidence
         as, kinkily, "cameras aren't allowed" - so we may never know
         if its cheery orange schadenfreude now forms an essential part
         of any modern gimp costume...
