         on helpless: dragged away from everything that he knows,
         transported to the byzantine world of the court, where
         familiar, powerful figures debate whether he is yet too
         powerful and must be... destroyed. Yes, we sense much fear
         in BILL GATES. This week saw SUN using the force of law to
         stop Windows 98 shipping with an incompatible Java VM, AOL
         opening talks with Netscape, and the anti-trust trial judge
         laughing out loud at Bill's soulful silences in the video
         deposition. Meanwhile, Senator Ellison appears to be having
         another one of his fits, in which he suggested that perhaps
         Oracle servers could do without an full OS at all. Yeah,
         let's just do it with a bunch of PEEKs and POKEs, Larry.
         Sheesh, whose dark side are you on?

</span><span class="item">         Okay, so we've got two governments, both eager to encourage
         the new media sector of their economy. Both decide to
         commission a report. One goes to Vint Cerf, Don Heath, and
         the chair of Bell Atlantic. The other goes to a DIGITAL
         MEDIA ALLIANCE STEERING GROUP, including members of the
         Arts Council, a CD-ROM company, a media consultant, and
         someone from Channel 4. After some months, the first group
         recommends privatising the local loop, flat-rate charges for
         Net calls, and heavy investment in a public IP
         infrastructure. Within days, a scared national telco
         announces 33% cuts in Net phone charges, a flat-rate system
         to be implemented in two months and a "competitively-priced"
         DSL system by March. The other group recommends forming four
         new committees - one of which, intriguingly, will be
         called the "Alliance of Digital Media", and will initially
         consist of the same people who commissioned the report. Oh,
         and they also propose a special "zone" on the Web to
         showcase new, "grassroots" talent. Our question is: who had
         the prettier-looking report?

         WASSENAAR CRYPTO MEETING isn't happening, which is a good
         sign. Wassenaar is the widely-signed international agreement
         not to export weapons of mass destruction, dual-use
         technologies and - say France, Russia, the US and (quietly)
         the UK - strong cryptography. Apparently, most of European
         countries disagreed so heavily with the anti-crypto US line,
         that there was nothing to discuss. More no news, we hope on
         Tuesday, when the Queen's speech will reveal whether the DTI
         are leaving their own half-baked crypto controls in the oven
         for just a little bit longer...

         Cracking The Maze: Game Plug-ins And Patches As Hacker Art

         current tweakable releases Carmageddon 2: Carpocalypse Now

         realising that they're outclassed by real coders, or -
         equally understandable - the world's most desperate trawl
         for the semi-mythical, barely stable "Nude Raider" patch.

         the Web was *supposed* to be annotatable - it should be as
         easy to add and edit Web documents, he says, as it is to
         browse them. To see what kind of mess that would have lead
         to, you might like to check out the WIKI WIKI WEB, an easy
         to set-up, easy-to-understand, impossible-to-administrate
         "collaborative environment". In many ways, it's a
         self-perpetuating mess (it took us half an hour to work out
         how to get the source), but - like the Xanadu project it
         superficially resembles - it can't help but gland a few key
         geek hormones. The original Wiki is a tiny Perl script, but
         versions now exist in Python, Squeak, and other places where
         geeks do the Right Thing so much it becomes Wrong Again.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; celebrities in need of a good kicking, more like, with
         the usual B-list nobodies and bands plugging Christmas
         singles supposedly in aid of CHILDREN IN NEED (from 7pm,
         Fri, BBC1)... maybe Simon "Alan Parker" Munnery and techno
         uber-spoof The Pod can transcend the dire low-budget
         limitations of COMEDY NATION (12.30am, Fri, BBBC2)... BOOKED
         (8pm, Sat, C4) tries to establish if nature or nurture
         produces pop-sci books like Richard Dawkins' new "Unweaving
         The Rainbow"... and while they marketed Crichton thriller
         DISCLOSURE (9pm, Sat, ITV) as the latest Michael Douglas
         battle of the sexes romp, in fact it's a daft VR thriller
         about the use of clean rooms in CDROM drive manufacture...
         with b&amp;w nuke parable THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL (4.05pm,
         Sun, C4) following last week's Forbidden Planet, looks like
         Sunday afternoon is "scifi classic with a robot holding a
         swooning girl on the poster" time. Oi! Channel 4! Klaatu
         barada nikto!... still, better than F/X-lite Marvel
         adaptation GENERATION X (9pm, Sun, C5) - for Matt "Max
         Headroom" Frewer completists only... WORLD IN ACTION (8pm,
         Mon, ITV) cynically targets parents of kids cynically
         targeted by TV ads... and C5's porn schedule has a lot to
         answer for, as WITNESS (9pm, Mon, C4) casually observes
         naturists vs nudists, and BBC2 starts a pioneering series of
         ugly people talking about their bodies while NAKED (9.50pm,
         Wed, BBC2)... MODERN TIMES (9.30pm, Tue, BBC2) rides the
         rollercoaster history of Alton Towers pleasure park...
         across the ITV networks, an interdimensional portal has
         opened - to reveal minor recent parallel universe movie
         DOORWAYS (12.30am, Wed, ITV)... and: "I am *disgusted* to
         notice that you've *completely* failed to take the piss out
         of us Acorn users again," complains one self-loathing
         RISC-taker over the non-existent Acorn Phoebe machine used
         as a non-linear edit suite in extreme sports vehicle PIRATE
         TV (around 1.40am, Thu/Fri, some ITV). See comp.sys.acorn.*
         for further details...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; casting Matt Damon in virtually his Good Will Hunting
         role again makes ROUNDERS (imdb: judge / law-school / mafia
         / new-york / poker / prison) a bit of a gamble, but it's a
         safe bet for fans of poker or John "The Last Seduction" Dahl
         - and at least it's not the girls' version of baseball...
         DEAD MAN'S CURVE (imdb: black-comedy / college / humor /
         suicide / urban-legend) almost combines Scream humour (and
         Hackers "star" Matthew Lillard) with student murder,
         sub-Heathers-style... Roger Ebert hypothesises that the
         mystery briefcase in lame De Niro nothing-to-do-with
         Frank-Miller Euro yawn RONIN (imdb: betrayal) contains "the
         briefcase from Pulp Fiction". Either that or an explanation
         of whether the car chases are trying to re-enact a) Diana's
         death crash, or b) Konami arcade game GTI Rally Cote
         D'Azur... "miserable" accurately describes the cast, tedium,
         song-free plot of LES MISERABLES (imdb: based-on-novel /
         historical / paris) - Neeson! Thurman! Danes!... so probably
         more laughs in taking your Heinlein-loving libertarian pals
         to risible Ayn Rand re-release THE FOUNTAINHEAD (imdb:
         architect / courtroom / heiress / newspaper / suicide)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         "OUT OF MY WAY, FANBOY", WITH LEE MAGUIRE AND BEN MOOR&gt;&gt; Top
         of the pile is YOU ARE HERE (UKP15) by Kyle "Why I Hate
         Saturn" Baker, an extension of some of the bits from Dark
         Horse's much missed 'Instant Piano'... also in the comedy
         section, Kevin Smith's slackfest JAY AND SILENT BOB finally
         gets to its second issue - a good bet if you're interested
         in the backstory of upcoming anti-religion comedy 'Dogma'.
         Smith is also writing the only one of the new Marvel Knights
         books nearly worth reading: DAREDEVIL. It's like reading a
         teenager's essay titled "Does God Exist? And if He Does, Why
         Does He Let Pretty Girls Get AIDS?" but with better pictures
         (the Black Widow hasn't looked so great in years). Bullseye
         returns next month: corny issue zero shockwave preview at
         <a href="http://www.marvel.com/special_events/mknights/mknights.html">http://www.marvel.com/special_events/mknights/mknights.html</a>
         But best Smith-based book has to be: the manga Chasing Amy
         (<a href="http://www.viewaskew.com/jsbstash/chasingamy.html#amymanga">http://www.viewaskew.com/jsbstash/chasingamy.html#amymanga</a>)
         ... SPIDER-MAN's relaunch with two new number ones has been
         welcomed with altogether controlled excitement in shops:
         DC-heads are meanwhile coveting the hardcover, slipcased
         limited edition of CRISIS ON INFINITE EARTHS, probably the
         best maxi-series in superhero history and almost worth the
         near infinite price of UKP75... but the toys for Christmas
         have got to be the 6-inch SPY VS SPY action figures -
         available in the next couple of weeks, around UKP10. They
         each come with their own suitcases of bombs and hammers and,
         brilliantly, you really need a pair. Buy! Fight! Spy! Vs!
         Spy! Life's a riot, as they say...
