</span><span class="item">         If there's no such thing as a free lunch, how come everybody
         wants in? FREESERVE continues to jerk the chain with Dixons'
         announcement of 900,000 accounts - over half of which are being
         used! - although Dixons chairman Stanley Kalms didn't say it
         with the hugest of grins. Perhaps that deal with Energis
         (you get the interconnect charges: we'll take the ad
         revenue) wasn't the corker he imagined? AOL, who months ago
         were boasting of their 500,000 figure, now say they've found
         some hiding under the servers, and really have a million 
         customers, because after all, each household can have more
         than one e-mail address, right? And that scary ghost-woman
         off the telly ads, she counts too. AOL also sniped 
         that Freeserve's figures were "disingenuous", which implies
         that they don't know what that word means. We couldn't
         confirm several reports that AOL/COMPUSERVE are misleading
         wavering users with "Freeserve about to announce charges"
         claims - although our test unsubscriber seemed very pleased
         with the *two* free months she was bribed with - free ISPs
         everywhere! Unpleasantly needy BRITISH TELECOM, meanwhile,
         are asking Oftel for a bigger cut of the interconnect
         charges "to support the cost of the local loop". Ah, yes,
         that publicly-subsidised wire into everyone's home - what
         an albatross around the neck that must be. Of course, poor
         as an orphan child and straddled with restrictive Oftel
         controls as it is, BT would never co-operate on implementing
         a free Internet service themselves - or would they, TESCO.NET?

</span><span class="item">         Nice to see Librettos being put to better use than as
         portable Quake-stations: last Monday, RODDY MANSFIELD and
         his associates from the video newszine UNDERCURRENTS
         barricaded themselves into Shell's London offices to protest
         the company's mistreatment of the citizens of the Niger
         Delta. Hours later they were forcibly expelled by police,
         who smashed through partition walls to arrest them. Despite
         Shell cutting off light and electricity, the team managed to
         issue press releases and photos via the 133Mhz Tosh, a
         cellular modem and digital camera. It's a hack that could
         have wider applications. As previous Undercurrents docs have
         shown, Police officers at protests have taken to arresting
         legitimate videojournalists. After being released without
         charge, their tapes are returned too late for mainstream
         news programmes to use. In some cases, the police actively
         erase footage. Now, hardware hacker that you are, you'll
         realise that a handheld videocam feeding into a digitiser,
         broadcasting via a line o' sight link (2500MHz? 1900MHz?) to
         a mobile archive centre would provide these impromptu
         censors - and us eager Max Headroom fans - with... well,
         must-see TV. Think you'd like to help develop such a
         monster? Give our operators a bleep.

</span><span class="item">         And finally - a moment's silence, please for what must be
         the Falco du Falco. As of this Thursday, ACORN COMPUTERS is
         no more. In a statement to the press, the Acorn board
         (Hermann Hauser, Lesley Judd, Ian Macnaught-Davies, and
         Commander Jameson off of Elite) declared that "the brand
         values associated with Acorn are no longer an accurate
         reflection of the work that we are undertaking", and a new
         name was needed. And here it is: Element 14. Brand values
         associated with this new title are: confusion, discord,
         Milla Jovovitch, and barely restrained giggling. Element 14
         will concentrate on the Digital TV market. The symbolism,
         you understand, is from Silicon, which is the fourteenth
         element. The name does not derives from the fact that
         Acorn's new boxes run like they're powered by fourteen Acorn
         Electrons. Show some respect.

         Riverside Studios, Hammersmith, London at 5pm Saturdays from
         tomorrow (1999-01-16) - and yes, you even have to pay for
         it. Further details are at the self-explanatory "Lee And
         Herring Web Pages", along with 30 mins of exclusive
         out-takes from the last series, including unseen editions of
         "Pause For Thought For The Day", "When Insects Attack", "The
         School", and "Histor's Eye" - the absence of which,
         admittedly, was one of the highlights of the last live one
         we went to.

         Simon Gardner... giant computerised building goes mad,
         imprisons Paul "Aliens / Mad About You" Reiser in derivative
         '90s disaster sci-fi THE TOWER (12.35am, Fri, some ITV)...
         but it whiles away the hours waiting for the repeated,
         predictable but cute, birthday party episode of top geek
         sitcom DWEEBS (4.40am, Fri, C4)... ANIMAL MINDS (6pm, Sat,
         BBC2) presents a largely uncritical view of non-human
         "intelligent" behaviour - not a million miles away from
         BBC1's concurrent GENERATION GAME... but THE NATURAL WORLD
         (5.55pm, Sun, BBC2) restores some balance by exposing the
         darker side of those evilly grinning dolphins... caution:
         PROJECT ALF (5.20pm, Sun, C5) is the feature-length ET-style
         spin-off of the muppetty TV show... while this dedicated soul

         saved you the trouble of watching Anna Friel's dark, erotic,
         repeated drama THE TRIBE (11.05pm, Sun, BBC2)... the "Better
         Than Life" episode of RED DWARF (9pm, Mon, BBC2) is not
         based around what Craig Charles said when he got off on that
         rape charge... "How Come I'm Appearing 'Naked' Again In GQ?"
         is unlikely to be among Gail Porter's contributions to HOW
         II (4.50pm, Tue, ITV)... and "no crypto system is completely
         unbreakable" is the hidden message of four-part
         Enigma-breaking Bletchley Park docu-drama STATION X (9pm,
         Tue, C4)... SEINFELD / SANDERS (from 11.10pm, Tue, BBC2) pop
         up unexpectedly: catch them before they're "disappeared"
         again... a meek student visits a parallel universe where
         Rutger Hauer is still making zany sci-fi trash in
         CROSSWORLDS (9pm, Wed, C5)... mad (even by Chris Morris
         standards) ambient sketch show BLUE JAM returns, boldy ahead
         of the 2am watershed (12midnight, Radio 1, Wed)... and
         fortunately BLOOD ON THE CARPET (9.50pm, Wed, BBC2) is the
         story of how beardie-weirdie ice-creamers Ben &amp; Jerry took
         on Haagen-Dazs, and not the name of one of their new
         flavours...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; take up cinema's invitation to MEET JOE BLACK (imdb:
         comedy / romance) and, after the first hour or two, you
         really will be yearning for death's sweet embrace; it's yet
         another overlong Brad Pitt vehicle where he plays the Grim
         Reaper like Data out of Star Trek, and falls for Claire
         Forlani, the girl who once asked Colin out in Press Gang...
         so, worth tracking down THE OPPOSITE OF SEX (imdb: aids /
         ashes / gay / road / sex) - The Opposite Of Widely
         Distributed, more like - largely for Christina Ricci and
         Lisa Kudrow punching up this patchily misanthropic designer
         indie... else it's three films dealing variously with
         improbability - appropriate given your chances of finding a
         cinema showing them... Larry "Seinfeld" David's
         mean-spirited fruit-machine payout-sharer SOUR GRAPES (imdb:
         comedy)... interlinking Czech-made post-nuclear portmanteau
         THE BUTTONERS (imdb: coincidence / episodic /
         short-stories)... and Evil Dead-style over-grossing crime
         thriller DOBERMANN (imdb: gangster) - not based around the
         Sgt Bilko character of the same name...

         predicted NTK 1998-04-10, 1998-10-23) and - perhaps more
         surprisingly - established gadget-pornster STUFF, leaving
         Dennis Publishing's non-computer division with just MAXIM
         and, er, HOME ENTERTAINMENT... our analyst blames "TV babe
         tits fatigue", with Maxim, FHM and Loaded all losing
         circulation here, which FHM and Loaded (and the resurrected
         Stuff) hope to revitalise with upcoming US launches...
         taking transatlantic inspiration the other way, EMAP's
         foolhardy attempt to do a UK Entertainment Weekly will be
         called HEAT (due Feb), prompting NTK contrib Lloyd Wood's
         tagline: "Burn it for fuel"... meanwhile FRONTIERS
         charitably puts "Tomorrow's World" in big letters on its
         cover to both pay tribute to its deceased BBC Magazines
         rival, and to con bemused mums into buying it by accident...
         and no, that's not NTK ed Danny O'Brien posing with the
         nekkid ladies on the latest DAZED &amp; CONFUSED... newsgroup
         gossip on the OFFICIAL PLAYSTATION MAGAZINE Rollcage compo
         is that 23.10 is the time to beat; sources recommend a
         "250kph start" and a "good line onto beach"... buying the
         special Star Wars edition of VANITY FAIR reveals both the
         identity of the mystery thing on George Lucas's knee, and
         that the more you see of this new prequel, the worse it
         looks... but mag of the month goes to HITS MONTHLY (UKP2.50)
         who, in a bizarre double CGI-insect movie merchandising
         coup, devote their Jan issue entirely to Antz *and* A Bug's
         Life, with box-office battling stickers, posters, spotter's
         guides to real insects, and cast list filmographies
         obviously pasted (ahem) straight from the Internet Movie
         Database, right down to the ordinal numbers and quotes
         around TV shows: David Hyde-Pierce - 8."Frasier" (1993)
         9.Sleepless In Seattle 10."Powers That Be, The" (1992)...
