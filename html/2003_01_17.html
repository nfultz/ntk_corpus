</span><span class="item">         When you left us last Friday: Lord Falconer, minister in 
         charge of ID cards, was claiming that his consultation was 
         showing a 2:1 majority in favour of them. By Monday, thanks to 
         your mails via stand.org.uk, the ratio must have been more 
         like 2:1 against. At time of writing, with over 4000 new 
         responses in one week, we'd estimate it's now something like 
         80% anti, 20% pro. David Blunkett, who was tipped to announce 
         growing public support for the project at a conference on 
         Wednesday, instead talked of cabinet splits, and "not wanting 
         a revolution" over the proposals. Isn't it always a surprise 
         when you log in to check your inbox after the weekend?

                        - oh, you *say* you "don't want a revolution"
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         All very good, but we're still left wondering - who were those 
         original correspondents that were so gung-ho for the ID card? 
         We suggest the curious check out next Thursday's ENTITLEMENT 
         CARDS CONFERENCE. It's sponsored - and we can't think why - by 
         top government IT contractors EDS, Fujitsu, IBM, Siemens, and 
         SchlumbergerSema, and organised by trade lobby INTELLECT UK. 
         Ministers and civil servants will be speaking to this select 
         few - and it's not the first time they've popped over for 
         a chat. Back in early 2002, Intellect was meeting regularly 
         with the government, helping them with a "pre-consultation 
         paper" on how best to introduce ID cards to the public. 
         Intellect recommended a three phase roll-out. In the first 
         stage, "there would be no requirement to produce the card" 
         (a la the current consultation proposals). In phase two, we'd 
         all get government-issued X509 certificates (just like in 
         Revelations). But it's phase three that where it gets really 
         fascinating. For example: as part of an integrated tax-
         reporting database, "an intelligent benefits payments system 
         could recognise when a citizen's circumstances have 
         deteriorated, and ensure benefit payment is made 
         expeditiously." So you're looking at not only real-time 
         government monitoring of bank and tax records, but a paperclip 
         that jumps up and says "So, it looks like you got canned. 
         Would you like some help?"

</span><span class="item">         Ah, the time-honoured traditions of "stepping down": gathering 
         the contents of your desk into a black bin-liner; being 
         escorted out of the building by the security guard; the 
         ceremonial deletion of your home page from the company's 
         servers. But, as the ever-vigilant AOLWATCH.COM has spotted, 
         schadenfreude fans can still smile at the youthful idealism 
         of outgoing AOL chairman STEVE CASE - thanks to the mission 
         statement still currently hosted on his AOL page. Here, Case 
         confessed to being "very excited" about the merger with Time 
         Warner, saying the new company will continue to be guided by 
         principles that include "encouraging responsibility" and 
         "leaving no one behind". As AOLWatch notes, this is already a 
         cut-down version of his January 2001 flight of fancy, when he 
         earnestly predicted that AOL Time Warner would be "the premier 
         global company" in some field or another. All these moments 
         will be lost, delinked from Steve's cheery homepage - which 
         now forwards to an old bio with no mention of the $60billion 
         write-down he's being encouraged to take responsibility for.

         What? Oh. Well. Put 'em all in a free, world-accessible
         database then, where they can be put to some good use. Yes,
         2003 will be the year of geospatial hype, and the first
         usable free apps to help usher it in are stumbling,
         head-down, toward their goals. GPSDRIVE is a German mapping
         app for Linux which bypasses the whole proprietary map
         business by downloading images on the fly from Expedia and
         Mapblast. It's still got that icky "smells like Tcl" Linux 
         UI, but is gearing up with neat features, including random
         speech synthesis, integration with WiFi AP sniffers, and 
         a "friendsd" daemon, which lets gpsdrive users find each
         other on a live updated map. To add to the stew is Dan
         "sweetcode.org" Egnor's 2002 Google Programming Contest
         winner GEOGRAPHIC SEARCH, which uses the TIGER census data
         (freed by Bruce Perens) to convert any US address into
         Lat/Long co-ordinates, scrape addresses from free text, and
         other textogeospatialomagico. Co-ord collectors in the rest
         of the world are still saddled with government-created
         mapping data that isn't freely distributable, worse luck.
         But things are getting better: Joshua "memepool.com"
         Schachter's new project GEOURL.ORG is collecting together
         freely accessible Lat/Long decoding sites, as well as
         pooling a few waypoints himself with his location-to-URL
         reverse directory. Geospace! It's where it's at!

         referring of course to WRIGELY'S EXTRA THIN ICE (75p for pack 
         of 24 "stamp-sized vegetarian gel sheets", which release "a 
         powerful peppermint rush" when dissolved on your tongue, he 
         explains). The product appears to be "non-hallucinogenic", 
         Paddy clarifies - yet still qualifies as "awesome" in his 
         book. No word yet on how they measure against similarly sized 
         packs of LISTERINE ACTIVES or the more pharmaceutically potent 
         FINLAY'S SLIM MINTS (UKP2.95 for tin of 45), loaded with the 
         great taste of alleged appetite suppressants and metabolic 
         accelerants chromium polynicotinate and L-carnitine. And, by 
         international "functional food" standards, that's nothing - in

         BARRY MCCAULEY reports they've been selling VANILLA COKE in a 
         newsagents near his work (Colindale, London NW9) for "quite a 
         few weeks now", although French writing on the can leads him 
         to suspect it could be a "grey import". DANIEL WILSON claims 
         he "picked up a bag of SMARTIES COOKIES in Reading Tesco's" 
         which, inexplicably, reminded him of his mum's Chilli Con 
         Carne "the night it rained cockroaches when we were on 
         holiday", while NTK's own LEE MAGUIRE was first to note the 
         re-emergence of WALKERS (nee SMITHS) SALT AND SHAKE CRISPS:

         new "matt packaging". Look out for their BAKED BEAN FLAVOURED 
         CRISPS to tie in with Comic Relief in Match, with multipacks 
         incorporating a whoopee cushion delightfully labelled either 
         "Wet &amp; Windy", "Atom Bum" or "Sonic Boom"... and finally: "Why 
         not try all 3?" asks the back of the box for NESQUIK CEREAL
