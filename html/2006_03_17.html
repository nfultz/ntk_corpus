         catchup in London, but the fun certainly shouldn't be, with a 
         mix of new faces - TOM ARMITAGE, musing "Is Controller Design 
         Killing Creativity in Videogames?", plus DAN "geobloggers.com" 
         CATT providing co-ordinated coverage of SXSW Interactive - 
         amid some old familiars: NICK AND DOMINIC LUDLAM unveiling an 
         all-new version (and beta-test update?) of their Promise.TV 
         gigantic hard-drive PVR, and YOZ GRAHAME proudly showing you 
         round the metaphorical swings and roundabouts of "The Ning 
         Playground - A Springboard for New Social Software". And maybe 
         one or two special guests as well, if there's time. It's free 
         to attend (from 6.15pm Thu 2006-03-23, 01zero-one, Hopkins 
         Street, London W1F 0HS), making it all the more vital that you  
         promptly RSVP to the address on the official page. Or, if you 
         can't make it till later, from about 9pm onwards we'll be in a 
         nearby pub that offers both "megabytes" and "nanobytes" on the 
         menu, hopefully around 1,000,000 and 0.000000001 times the 
         size of a normal bar snack, respectively.

         Centre, Stanhope Place, London W2 2HH; "excursion" to Speakers

         and therefore must be destroyed. Our favourite counterpoint to 
         which is currently inspired by blogger James Boardwell: big 
         media is a bit like pre-invasion Iraq - famously dictatorial, 
         sitting on a vast stockpile of desirable resources - making it 
         the duty of all right-thinking web-users (or "second 
         superpower", if you will) to liberate these resources purely 
         by force of technological superiority, despite the lack of any 
         clear plan for what the old regime ought to be replaced with.

         offbeat electronic-ish artists' community, then Sunday may be 
         more of an "open mic" free-for-all science fair, culminating 
         in a "Guru Nerd's Question Time" between about 2 and 4pm in 
         the company of James "prawn sandwich clock" Larsson, Mike

         Void. And, finally, someone writes a decent open source GUI
         testing and automation library. DOGTAIL is a Python library
         for anything that supports the accessibility framework
         AT-SPI - which means, um, GNOME. (But KDE soon.) With it you
         can use procedural or OOPy Python to drive almost any Gnome
         app, plus Open-Office, and Mozilla-based apps like Epiphany
         (so you can automate web and test applications too). Driving
         code is ridiculously tight: you can automatically kick up a
         browser, enter a form, and rip out the resulting text with a
         just a few lines. It can drive multiple apps with all your
         hands tied behind your back. It can search out applications
         based on their package name, not the binary. It can send
         keystrokes to anything you damn well want. Your GUI is about
         to become posessed with dozens of your own private bots.

         that sampled John Thaw saying "That's what's really 'wicked', 
         Lewis" or "It's The Hallelujah Chorus, conducted by Sir Adrian 
         Boult!" in Danny Boyle's pre-"Shallow Grave" 1992 rave episode 
         of INSPECTOR MORSE (3.05pm, Sat, ITV1)... "Who are the real 
         monsters - zombies, or Christopher Eccleston's power-crazed 
         army?", ponders Boyle's 28 DAYS LATER (10.15pm, Sat, C4)... 
         while, half-way through both series, we're starting to prefer 
         "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers/ Midwich Cuckoos" clone 
         INVASION (8pm, Sun, C4) over "boy and his monster" nonsense 
         SURFACE (6.35pm, Sat; 8pm, Tue, ITV2), not least because the 
         latter clashes with the extended prime-time edition of folk-
         probability-analysis foolhardiness DEAL OR NO DEAL (7.15pm, 
         Sat, C4): <a href="http://donduk.blogspot.com/">http://donduk.blogspot.com/</a> ...
         
         Over on the BBC, LITTLE SHOPPING HORRORS (8pm, Mon, BBC3) 
         promises a look at "pester power", apparently as it relates to 
         video games... despite the efforts of Nick "Spaced" Frost and 
         and Nick "Nathan Barely" Burns, we confidently predict that 
         MAN STROKE WOMAN (9.30pm, Mon, BBC2) will be hailed as the 
         worst sub-"Spoons" sketch show of the decade... and is it just 
         us, or is THE APPRENTICE (9pm, Wed, BBC2) using all those 
         outside shots of Canary Wharf to try and create the impression 
         that that's where "the boardroom" is, though when candidates 
         finally are fired, they're often seen in front of Amstrad's 
         Brentwood House, which is obviously in Brentwood, Essex

         But, although they've ditched "Dream On" and "The Larry 
         Sanders Show", ITV4 remains our favourite Freeview channel 
         with a "4" in its name, this week debuting the 1970s live-
         action series of PLANET OF THE APES (6pm, Sun, ITV4) - 
         hopefully in a more rational order than they've managed so far 
         with UFO (7pm, Sat, ITV4) or SPACE: 1999 (7pm, Sun, ITV4)... 
         sadly, Kevin Smith's CLERKS: THE ANIMATED SERIES (10pm, Wed, 
         ITV4) never re-attains the heights of last week's "finished by 
         the Korean animators" opener - showing in a taboo-busting 
         double-bill with eating-disorders sitcom STARVED (10pm, Wed, 
         ITV4), which previously featured the lead character crawling 
         around the floor of a crowded colonic irrigation waiting room, 
         with a jet of "water" fountaining out of his, well, colon...
