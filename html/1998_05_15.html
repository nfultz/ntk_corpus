</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Bill Gates may be able to turn his company around on a
         dime, but only STEVE JOBS keeps his organisation swivelling
         like a top. At the Apple Developer Conference this week, he
         announced yet another graceful arc in corporate direction.
         Gone is the "I had to run NeXT: now you will too" mantra
         he'd been pitching to scared Mac developers for the last
         year: Rhapsody is no longer a separate product, and the
         previously fuddy-duddy MacOS is back, back, BACK! There are
         some changes: Jobs, inimitably, has taken his frustration
         out on low-level MacOS functionaries: around 2000 of the
         Mac's 8000 API calls have been slaughtered. That's okay,
         apparently, because no-one used them. And anyway, they
         disagreed with him. Rumours that calls to the old addresses
         will be secretly intercepted by NeXT managers hiding
         underneath the hardware abstraction layer, are, we assured,
         to be disbelieved.

               - Well, doh! We were holding the roadmap upside-down!
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         "Sorry we're late: the government made us do it" is an
         original excuse for MICROSOFT blowing shipping dates, but
         in this case, it's the truth. In a last minute face-off,
         Gates agreed to delay delivering Windows 98 to
         manufacturers until the DOJ could decide whether they want
         to sue his ass or not. Bill's generosity knows no bounds -
         the new shipping date is Monday, giving the DOJ less than
         72 hours to pull him in. Expect top government counsel to
         hand in their badges and go undercover to nab the
         international fugitive, who, as we speak, is planning to
         blow up Seattle's Space Needle using an embedded-NT timebomb
         and the wiles of his beautiful - yet deadly - assistant,
         Myhrvold.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Remember when NORTEL announced the IP-down-the-power-lines
         hack, and everyone racked their brains to work out the
         killer flaw? Was it, perhaps, the isolation equipment you'd
         have to install into every house that used it? Or the fibre
         lines Nortel would have to spool out from each substation?
         Well, here's a likely contender: Nick Long from the Low
         Power Radio Association reports that streetlamps in the
         Nortel trial region have been acting as highly efficient
         antennae, merrily broadcasting packets across much of the
         shortwave radio bands. Bad for radio hams, not brilliant for
         personal privacy - but what a great solution for
         multicasting Web events!

         Or is that just the flies? Whatever - icons on the rumours
         Workbench vary from the release of version 3.5 of ye
         anciente operating system, to the launch of sub-$500
         PC/Amiga hybrid, to Gateway giving up altogether on the
         hardware and telling everyone to scarper and buy third
         party mods (like Phase 5's PowerPC co-processor add-on)
         instead. Alas, our sources in the Amiga scene have all

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV &gt;&gt; nutty sci-fi fun with Prisoner fans in LOST IN SPACE
         (7.15pm, Fri, BBC2), followed by Contact-inspiring SETI-
         heads in new docu series QUANTUM LEAPS (7.30pm, Fri,
         BBC2)... Michael J Fox twists again in SPIN CITY (9.30pm,
         Fri, C4)... plus, great-looking Ridley Scott nonsense in
         Yakuza actioner BLACK RAIN (10.20pm, Fri, BBC1) - but
         where's The Adam And Joe Show?... early-morning repeat of
         RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (10.55am, Sat, BBC1) unlikely to
         feature the line "Holy shit" when Indy spots the U-boat...
         don't let your Swiss bodyguard fall asleep during THE
         GODFATHER PART III (9pm, Sat, BBC2)... and C4's promising
         "Lolita" theme-night is upsettingly interrupted by Joe
         Dante's B-movie tribute MATINEE (10pm, Sat, C4) - starring,
         in something of a trend for this week, Roseanne's John
         Goodman... MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATRE 3000 (12midnight, Sat,
         SciFi Channel) rips the limbs from 60's B(rit)-movie Devil
         Doll... Sunday's John Goodman film is Ellen Barkin erotic
         thriller SEA OF LOVE (10.25pm, Sun, BBC1)... Arizona-based
         Brit-thriller WHITE OF THE EYE (11.30pm, Sun, BBC2) has
         taken 12 years to reach TV screens - maybe the director
         could have killed himself earlier... at last, it's the
         free-climbing skyscraper repeat of THEY WHO DARE (7.15pm,
         Mon, BBC2)... chug a beer every time you spot Robert "T2"
         Patrick in the drinking game to liven up DIE HARD 2 (9pm,
         Mon, ITV)... then you're ready for the surprisingly cogent
         psychedelic sensory deprivation of ALTERED STATES (10.55pm,
         Mon, C5)... more millennial panic-mongering in KNOCKING ON
         DOOMSDAY'S DOOR (10.40pm, Tue, ITV)... no Bruce Willis in
         this DAY OF THE JACKAL (11.15pm, Wed, BBC1), but - of
         course - *more* John Goodman in EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN
         (12.15am, Wed, some ITV)... Planet Mirth's Ben Moor plays a
         "fight-o-gram" in MEN BEHAVING BADLY (9.30pm, Thu, BBC1),
         and guesting in mildly amusing Tom Hanks stand-up saga,
         PUNCHLINE (9pm, Thu, C5), why - it's *John Goodman*...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES &gt;&gt; a good week for Bill Murray fans, first with
         fantastically over-the-top Neve Campbell naughtiness WILD
         THINGS (imdb: thriller / mystery / crime / police /
         bisexual / sailing / mother-daughter / pool / drama /
         erotica / drugs / alligator / high-school / florida /
         school / sexual-harassment / teaching / sex / doublecross /
         threesome / lesbian / lesbian-scene / twist-in-the-end /
         murder / rape) - and, by the way, very little to do with
         Tone Loc's 1980s rap hit of almost the same name... a
         bigger role, but fewer laughs, for Bill in overcontrived
         spy spoof THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE (MPAA: rated PG for
         "language, innuendo, comic violence and sensuality"), like
         a comedy version of David Fincher's The Game... the touchy-
         feely title gives a clue that it's the *emotional* impact
         they're more interested in, in Tea Leoni's DEEP IMPACT
         (imdb: thriller / sci-fi / action / apocalypse / drama /
         disaster / meteor-threatens-earth)... Tim Roth denies
         killing Jerry Maguire's Renee Zellweger in too-clever
         polygraph puzzler LIAR (imdb: known in US as "Deceiver")...
         and complex plot-strands meet wacky sex in Almodovar's LIVE
         FLESH (imdb: drama / adultery / jealousy / birth / based-
         on-novel / sex / bus / wheelchair / paraplegic / marital-
         abuse / basketball) - apparently based on a novel by Ruth
         Rendell...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MAGS &gt;&gt; putting the "dead" back into "dead tree publishing"
         - seems everyone knows about DENNIS PUBLISHING selling
         their business mags (most too boring to mention) to
         somewhere in Surrey, especially since the editor of
         COMPUTER TRADE SHOPPER went mad slagging the company off on
         his (final?) credits page... also, doesn't look like
         they'll be doing the official MINISTRY (Of Sound) mag much
         longer either... ground-breaking retro-fetishising BEN IS
         DEAD &lt; <a href="http://www.benisdead.com">www.benisdead.com</a> &gt; is, er, dead, though editor
         Darby will apparently continue with her other zine,
         Socially Fucking Retarded... from the ashes of misguided
         "let's put it all on the net" project: OMNI renegades are
         to start new Webzine ominously called EVENT HORIZON... and
         is <a href="http://fitshaced.com/">http://fitshaced.com/</a> the true heir to Jim Goad's hate-
         fuelled ANSWER ME?... back over here, IPC's VOX is, at
         last, silenced, following a failed US-style redesign.
         "Somebody *stop* us," chirrups the final editorial,
         unwittingly... also rumours that GOAL has been similarly
         disallowed, just in time not to pick up any new readers
         from all that exciting World Cup hoo-hah next month... and
         (very) finally: Future's CULT TV seems to have run its last
         Randall And Hopkirk Deceased episode guide - though
         wouldn't it be ironic if a small minority audience suddenly
         started re-appreciating it in 20 years' time?...
