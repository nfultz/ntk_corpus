</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         This week, our American cousins like to say thanks, and give 
         something back for the gifts they've received the rest of the 
         year. Considering the "gifts" NTK gives out, that's usually 
         our cue to lie a little low. But, for the record, we'd like to 
         formally deny giving the gift of unemployment to accidental 
         spammer DAVID DOCHERTY, who has left his job at Telewest just 
         a week after accusing us of being "quite fair". He will be 
         concentrating on his novels, and endlessly prattling about how 
         the future of broadband lies with ex-television producers 
         like, well, off the top of our heads - himself? 
</span><span class="trailing_urls">       <a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,848939,00.html">http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,848939,00.html</a>
      - "developing a number of new broadband services independently"
         <a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02002-11-08&amp;l=47#l">http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02002-11-08&amp;l=47#l</a>
                     - slightly too broad, slightly too independently
</span><span class="item_space">         
</span><span class="item">         Neither did we - we think - give the gift of hubris to open 
         source evangelist ERIC S RAYMOND, whose personal blog - "Armed 
         And Dangerous" - uses logic and free thought to reach the same 
         certainties that sixteen pints of "Ayn's Old Prejudicial" and 
         a roomful of cab drivers might manage in an evening. Previous 
         heated debates in Eric's head have included male homosexuality 
         (they like little boys), the nature of Islam ("warlike and 
         bloody", the lot of 'em), and dietary tips (meat and two veg: 
         it's evolution, mate). But only this week, Eric has invented a 
         way that Al-Qaeda could cripple America, sworn himself and his 
         conspirators to dread secrecy, then reassured the world that 
         should bin Laden's cronies try to torture him for his secrets, 
         he will give them a "very short education in what the wrath of 
         Allah is really like". Next up: following a politically 
         motivated cop-shooting in California, Eric asks when *is* it 
         acceptable to gun down a police officer? When, he argues, 
         they come to round up all the guns, pornography, computers, or 
         Jewish people in your area. (We're guessing that should they 
         come for the homosexuals, Muslims, or non-Atkins dieters, get 
         a second opinion before opening fire.) Oh, we'd like to think 
         that it's just one big troll, but there's a real tone of 
         desperate decline to it all. It's like watching Larry Ellison 
         channel Charlton Heston; it's like Cliff from "Cheers" truly 
         going postal; but most of all, it's like finally realising you 
         no longer have to defend Eric S Raymond to anyone any longer. 
         And for that, thanks for a true gift from God.

</span><span class="item">         And you - how could you express your notional free-floating 
         gratitude? Well, you could not buy any videogames during the 
         week Sunday 2002-12-01 to 2002-12-08, as proposed by the 
         FAIRPLAY CAMPAIGN FOR CHEAPER VIDEOGAMES, who'll be protesting 
         the high price of gaming with leaflets and cosplay "stunts" 
         outside high-street stores. The campaign has gathered a wide 
         variety of support, ranging from games journo firebrand STUART 
         CAMPBELL to former Tomorrow's World presenter LINDSEY FALLOW 
         and e-commerce site BARKMAN ONLINE. And, sure, it'll be tough 
         getting through the next 7 days without hot-off-the-presses 
         copies of "Powerpuff Girls: Relish Rampage" (PS2), "Rugrats: 
         I Gotta Go Party" (GameBoy Advance), and the Spearmint Rhino-
         endorsed "Private Dancer" (PC only), but desperate times call 
         for desperate measures, and anything that winds up humourless 
         games-biz body ELSPA is OK by us.

         Redundant Technology Initiative, mainly), the mysterious 
         "Resurrection of the Macintoshes" ritual will be going ahead 
         at tomorrow's DRAGONMEET role-playing convention (10am-11pm, 
         Sat 2002-11-30, Kensington Town Hall, London W8, UKP7). These 
         ancient Apple machines, weathered many different shades of 
         beige, will be used to create an entire RPG during the course 
         of the day, just one of a list of attractions which also 
         includes Games Workshop, MechWarrior, Dune LARP, the British 
         Isles Traveller Support group, and - as ever - John Kovalic, 
         creator of "Dork Tower". Continuing the "Blue Peter"-style 
         "events seeking hardware" appeals, bunker-based LAN party 
         G2002 (from 9.30am, Sat 2002-12-14 to 2002-12-16, Kelvedon 
         Hatch, Essex UKP40), are offering "UKP25 off a 3-day ticket" 
         to the "first person to promise to bring a 48-port 100mbit 
         switch to the event", if you get in touch before Sat 2002-12-
         07. It's not quite how they selected the future of humanity in 
         films like "Deep Impact" and "When Worlds Collide", but there 
         you go.

         IMPOSSIBLE (9pm, Fri, BBC2) takes on the challenge of making a 
         wooden submarine - next week, they attempt a clearly quite 
         possible Roman siege catapult, rather than, say, a chocolate 
         teapot... the better-than-you'd-expect movie selection 
         includes Farrelly-brothers feelgooder THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT 
         MARY (9pm, Fri, ITV), above-average giant-worm sequel TREMORS 
         II: AFTERSHOCKS (11.20pm, Fri, BBC1), plus Brit sci-fi classic 
         THE DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE (1.15am, Fri, BBC2)... and 
         another crime writer reckons that makes them some sort of 
         expert in IAN RANKIN'S EVIL THOUGHTS (7.05pm, Sat, C4)... De 
         Niro is intriguingly cast against type as an obsessive stand-
         up in Scorsese's funniest film, THE KING OF COMEDY (11.35pm, 
         Sat, BBC2)... Adam Baldwin is abducted by sex-mad aliens in 
         sci-fi nonsense MIND BREAKERS (12midnight, Sat, C5)... and the 
         difficulties faced by Thai male-to-female transsexuals are 
         sensitively portrayed in NO COCK IN BANGKOK (1.40am, Sat, C4) 
         ... Sunday is Greta Scacchi night as she plays Maggie Thatcher 
         in JEFFREY ARCHER - THE TRUTH (9pm, Sun, BBC1) and a nudity-
         prone Kenyan contemporary of Jacqueline "Servalan" Pearce in 
         WHITE MISCHIEF (11.30pm, Sun, BBC1)... while a tedious street 
         magician stands on a pole in DAVID BLAINE'S VERTIGO (9pm, Sun, 
         C4)... a divorcee demonstrates how to pull in car parks in 
         HYPERSEX (9pm, Tue, BBC2)... HITLER'S BRITAIN (9pm, Tue, C5) 
         looks at how things might be if the Nazis had won - for a 
         start, would there be more WW2 documentaries, or less?... and 
         might we also have been spared the horror of STAR WARS EPISODE 
         1: THE PHANTOM MENACE (8pm, Tue, ITV)?... THE GREAT REALITY TV 
         SWINDLE (10.35pm, Tue, C4) appears to refer to a specific 
         incident, rather than the overall genre... the incessant 
         cross-promotion continues in THE REAL JAMES BOND'S GADGETS 
         (8pm, Wed, C5)... and a Playstation games tester becomes an 
         racing driver in FAKING IT (9pm, Wed, C4), contrasting with 
         Edge magazine's opinion that profiling videogamers would have 
         been no use when HUNTING THE WASHINGTON SNIPER (8pm, Thu, C4)...

         Allen, Judge "Beverly Hills Cop" Reinhold, and Michael 
         "Commander Worf" Dorn - together at last! - in depressingly

         <a href="http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/">http://adbusters.org/campaigns/bnd/</a> - but if you live outside 
         the UK and don't order a t-shirt before next Friday, you might 
         not get it before Christmas. But anytime before then is fine. 
         Now back to tempt you at <a href="http://www.ntkmart.com/">http://www.ntkmart.com/</a> is a new 
         white-outlined version of the NTK "They Stole Our Revolution" 
         design, available for the first time in traditional sysadmin 
         black; other people's protests like the FairPlay Campaign, the 
         Corrupt Disc logo, and the Redundant Technology Initiative; 
         plus old favourites like "Adminspotting" and a "Hi-Score 
         Table" which now glows in the dark... thankfully, nothing too 
         seasonal in your compo entries this month, with MATTHEW ALDOUS 
         taking an early lead in the "What the?" stakes with his 
         command line suggestions of "shirt | tee", "Hi^Ha^H^H" 
         (translates as "Hi. This is funny. Forget it", he claims), or 
         even "ntk^U^Y" - "implying the NTK meme has been copied". ANDY 
         BRICE joined the hardcore fun with his "catch ( exception&amp; e )
         {cerr &lt;&lt; "Thats weird\n"; cerr &lt;&lt; "It works on my machine\n";}"
         though we also enjoyed "Philip Glass half empty", anonymously 
         suggested without any indication of whether it was supposed to 
         be a t-shirt slogan or not. Yet the most poignant took the 
         form of BOB JORDAN's sober, retro-games-style reminder that we 
         all only have "1 Life Remaining", TAM FREESTONE-BAYES' "Treat 
         me like an object" definition <a href="http://tamagen.com/tshirt1/">http://tamagen.com/tshirt1/</a> , 
         and KASS SCHMITT's riposte to all those "geek girl" ideas we 
         got a while ago, the patch error "1 out of 1 hunk FAILED". As 
         ever, let us know if you can't get by without one of the above 
         in your wardrobe, or if you've got any better ideas... "Buy 
         One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get One Free" submissions have 
         meanwhile continued in their own erratic fashion, with 
         (presumed) NTK reader DAN LAUFER unexpectedly popping up in 
         games trade mag DEVELOP wearing one of our old "Ant Attack" 
         shirts - evidence at: <a href="http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/">http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/</a> . No 
         free shirt for him, though, as "Develop" doesn't technically 
         qualify as "mass media", a rule which 2001 winner VORTEX also 
         fell foul of when he appeared on BBC London local TV news 
         talking about war driving (again). Undeterred, Vortex reckons 
         you'll definitely be able to identify his shirt in his next 
         scheduled appearance on global internet, cable and satellite 
         "Reuters TV", though he has so far neglected to tell us when. 
         Watch the skies, readers - keep watching the skies...
