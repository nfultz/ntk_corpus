</span><span class="tagline">                             with Beverley Hughes
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Thanks to (what we assume must have been) the anonymous NTK
         reader who wrote to their MP Anne McIntosh to ask how many
         STAND contributions were received by the Home Office's ID
         card consultation. Ta too to whoever tipped off the Earl of
         Northesk to ask in the House of Lords what they were going
         to do about it. Both got their Ministerial replies this
         week. It's mixed news. Turns out that the Home Office did
         count all those emails after all, and lo and behold 4856 of
         them were against. Which means, as the BBC said in their
         news headline, that an overwhelming majority of the
         consultation responses were against ID cards, not for, as
         the ministers had been saying previously.
</span><span class="trailing_urls">         <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3004376.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3004376.stm</a>
                                  - another Home Office U-turn, maybe
         <a href="http://tinyurl.com/et48">http://tinyurl.com/et48</a>
                                        - Ms Hughes gives the figures
         <a href="http://tinyurl.com/et32">http://tinyurl.com/et32</a>
                           - or is it 4000? Make up your minds, kids!
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Meanwhile, upstairs, the Earl of Helpdesk was told that the
         contributions would be treated a bit like "a teletext
         survey". Which isn't quite as bad as it sounds. One of the
         biggest reasons STAND got involved was that Home Office
         ministers were lauding their initial two thousand responses
         as though it was a referendum on how cool ID cards were -
         when in fact, numerically, that claim had as much validity
         as a slashdot poll (or hell, a teletext poll, if it had
         Cowboy Neal as an option). Consultations are good for
         gathering a range of views. But they're not supposed to be
         a show of hands. Any politician who claims that the
         consultation provided a majority of support is going to get
         their heads bitten off by our all-wise media and opposition
         from now on. We hope.
</span><span class="trailing_urls">         <a href="http://tinyurl.com/et4b">http://tinyurl.com/et4b</a>

                   - now *here's* a real multiple-choice consultation
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Finally, it looks like they're postponing the whole thing
         until after Summer recess, which is a relief. Also postponed
         - again - is the UK's implementation of the Euro-DMCA, the
         EUCD. They don't even say when they plan to have that done
         by. Maybe they're hoping it'll just go away. Expect a
         speedier press release from Parliament's ALL-PARTY SPAM
         SUMMIT on July 1st, although I'm sure we'll wait and wait
         and see for results. It's invite only: we really hope
         they've included the Nigerian Ambassador. Also coming up,
         sometime, from those crazy politicos: an explanation as to
         exactly how the police plan to run the Internet, as they
         will be empowered to do in times of emergency by the new
         Civil Contingencies Bill. We have these vague visions of
         traffic police standing on routers, waving the packets
         through...

</span><span class="item">         No tracking this week: just a hole for rent. With the launch
         of the Treo and that Palm-on-a-watch thing, and with
         smartphones slinking in all over the place, we have to ask:
         where are the open source handheld scripting development
         environments? Yeah, we know you can download the SDK at
         home, but where's the challenge in that. You want to sit and
         hack on your *watch*. Kids in playgrounds should be writing
         shitty games with swearwords in them in BASIC until the
         screen makes them go blind and the keyboards turn their
         fingertips to callouses. We're not despairing: we're sure
         there's J2EE-friendly onscreen Jython interpreter out there,
         or a way of coding OML on Symbian phones, or a RISC Basic
         port to PalmOS 5. But we don't have all these platforms, so
         we can't test them - or, indeed, be bothered to look. Tell
         us, and we'll gullibly list the supposed "best" at some
         point. Or write one, and start a new Cambrian explosion of
         teen hacking, the like we've not seen since Mr Sinclair was
         alive.
