         certainly trapped in an environmental stasis field for the
         holidays. The EUROPEAN COPYRIGHT DIRECTIVE, aka the evil
         EuroDMCA, has been postponed. Thanks to your three hundred or
         so comments on the UK Patent Office's consultation document,
         the government has admitted that it'll have to go back to
         the drawing board. They've postponed the law until March
         2003 instead of the 2002 Christmas pressie we were all
         expecting. An excellent result, given that a) the original
         British draft had almost all of the bad bits of the EUCD
         with none of the handy get-out clauses, and b) up until now,
         the government has claimed that to miss the original
         deadline would be "In Serious Breach Of Treaty", with
         punishments including exile from the EU and being forced to 
         beg for subsidies on the streets of Norway.

         things have happened - are happening, indeed. We're
         currently watching the Home Office with something almost
         approaching sympathy, as they attempt a new consultation
         over this year's RIP "give spying powers to parish councils"
         statutory instrument. Their first port of call, naturally,
         was the wise yet opinionated folk of the ukcrypto mailing
         list. Three weeks on, dozens of longwinded threads, a
         smattering of Ross Anderson prophecies of doom, and
         hundreds of emails later, the list is still in major thrash
         mode. Three hundred comment documents must look like a
         couple of Post-Its to the beleagured HO subscribers.
         Unless, of course, drowning us all in nitpicking discussions
         while they get on with the dirty work is exactly what our
         betters *want* to happen...

</span><span class="item">         Looks like JASON CLIFFORD, a man who has had his fair share
         of ups and downs on the Usenet reputation rollercoaster, 
         has been wheeling out another well-meaning, if slightly
         controversial, project. The father of UK distro Definite
         Linux and founder of uklinux.net split with the latter
         company earlier this year after he felt that their plan 
         to plough money into the Free Software movement from
         UKLinux's dialup ISP profits wasn't really happening. Now
         he's launched the UK Free Software Network - a new ISP
         which, he says, really will pay back the community. In a
         nice twist, he's setting up public accounts to show what's
         going on. Really public. Every month, UKFSN promises to post
         up the company's profit and loss on their website, for
         everyone to see. It's an ambitious undertaking, and seeing
         as UKFSN seems to be a bit of a one-man operation, we hope
         Jason hasn't bitten off more than he can chew. But even if
         you don't support it, it'll be interesting to see if these 
         mini-ISPs really are a Perl script for making money
         (Clifford claims that UKLinux pulled in over 120,000UKP a
         year). And for the time being, who can fault a dial-up
         service whose current status report includes "In what I can
         only describe as a screw up of monumental proportions, I had
         forgotten to turn on PHP support" from the CEO?

</span><span class="item">         Anyone who saw his storming depiction of weird-ass NAT
         tunnelling at last year's Codecon knows that you don't get
         much more twisted copper-pair than Dan Kaminsky. That boy is
         to data packets what Magneto is to iron filings. So it's
         with some trepidation that we announce a public snapshot of
         Dan's current mental state in PAKETTO KEIRETSU, a grab-bag
         of sick and evil things done with bits on a wire. Stateless
         port-scanners, traceroutes so far down the OSI Networking
         model they're into the negative numbers, ethernet trailer
         steganography, a userland "virtual router" that uses
         ethernet multicast to let machines on a network share the
         same IP address (think of it as NAT turned inside out). If
         that's not enough, there's a graphics dumper that takes
         those strange-attractor fingerprints of sequence ids and
         turns it into a 3D voxel plot, and the usual fine
         caffeinated stream o' consciousness Kaminskytron prose to
         penetrate. As ever, it's not quite what these
         mini-utilities do as much as how the hell they do it. Not
         black hat or white hat but *deep* hat going on here.
