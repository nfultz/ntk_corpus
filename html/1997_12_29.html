<span class="header">         [Happy New Year! As perhaps befits the home of the digital
         antichrist, our server crashed over the holiday period, but
         that's OK because we weren't planning on doing our usual
         Friday-afternoon sarcastic round-up of technology news
         anyway. What do you think we are, insane? So, to tide you
         over until the return of NTK Classic next Friday
         (09/01/98), here's a special retro-update of last year,
         plus a bumper edition of TV and misc media that you've
         probably missed already. And before you ask, MiniNTKs are
         traditionally always slightly larger than the real thing.
         For historical reasons, you understand.]

         different. Marine pulse rifles were cosmetically customised
         Tommy guns, while the Starship Troopers' ones are obviously
         cut-down pump-action 12-gauge shotguns mounted underneath
         M16s sheathed in a fibreglass stock that converts them to a
         'bullpup' configuration (ie, the magazine is behind the
         pistol grip)."

         everyone liked even when the power supply turned out to be
         dodgy and the lettering started rubbing off the keys.
         Psion, by way of celebration, ran out of stock, but was
         saved from financial embarrassment when DELL bought loads
         of their cellular modems because no-one in the States

         QuickCam stuck on a Big Trak on Mars, thanks to a party
         pack of balloons and a dodgy modem. MIR did everything it
         could to be an orbiting disaster short of crash into the
         Plutonium-laden CASSINI. The space probe PIONEER 10 left
         the Solar System, only to be destroyed by Klaa of the
         Klingon battleship Okrona in "Star Trek V" (3.30pm, Fri Jan

         domain naming system collapsed), "blundered" (when JUDGE
         ZOBEL e-mailed his Woodward judgement to an ISP in the
         middle of a power cut), and "was on the edge of collapse"
         (every time a clueless hack couldn't get his e-mail).
         Simultaneously, the media raved about how the Net was
         "creating a new economy" (so, when was the last time you
         visited <a href="http://www.BarclaySquare.co.uk">www.BarclaySquare.co.uk</a>?), "revolutionising
         medicine" (CU-SeeMe remote bypass operations, anyone?), and
         "helping kids in school" (to download pornography and run
         warez sites, perhaps). The BBC spent millions on the now
         *fascinatingly appalling* <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk">www.bbc.co.uk</a> . WIRED UK shut
         down, along with a whole newsagent's POS display of other
         useless net mags. WIRED US talked about how great it had
         been, and pundits raved about LARA CROFT, DVD and DIGITAL

         One guy tried to blackmail Netscape into paying him for his
         crash code, and got threatened with jail. EUGENE KASHPUREFF
         exploited a bug to take over the Internic for a day, and
         went to jail. The Labour Party hackers and COLDFIRE helped
         the police with their enquiries. KEVIN MITNICK remained in

         up trying to beat Microsoft with OS/2, and took it out on
         Gary Kasparov. The US forbade companies from exporting hard

         you could "Shoot Bill Gates In The Face" with a full-size

         Admittedly, labelling everyone with their domain name

         Buck Rogers In The 25th Century)... and if you can't decide
         between the various madcap, irreverent etc hosts to see in
         the New Year, set your clock for "20 minutes into the
         future" - the original TV pilot movie for MAX HEADROOM
         (9pm, Wed, C4), featuring the boardroom from "Network",
          blipverts, digital watch tunes, and - of course - the
         ZikZak Corporation ("We make everything you need/ You need
         everything we make")...

         WEEK 01: a mildly autistic child composer is surprised to
         find himself described as a "nerd" in VIDEO DIARIES
         (10.55pm, Sat, BBC2)... we don't normally do satellite, but
         then they don't usually show anything as good as the TV
         spin-off of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (8pm, Sat, Sky 1):
         cute, violent, astonishingly funny - it's a barely-legal
         Sabrina The Teenage Witch!... Meryl Streep is trapped in a
         nightmare game of Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon on THE RIVER
         WILD (7.15pm, Sun, BBC1), while Luc Besson draws a bead on
         useless Hollywood remakes in his assassination actioner LA
         FEMME NIKITA (11.50pm, Sun, C4)... you guessed it, the two-
         part "sequel" to sixties sci-fi THE INVADERS (9pm, Sun-Mon,
         C5) is yet duller than the original, though it still
         features Roy Thinnes as "architect David Vincent"... oh,
         the irony that pits NEIGHBOURS FROM HELL (8.30pm, Mon, ITV)
         against NEIGHBOURS AT WAR (9.30pm, Mon, BBC1) - better off
         with Steve Martin's spectacular "special purpose" in THE
         JERK (9pm, Mon, BBC2)... Oliver Morton (something to do
         with Wired) and Ben Woolley (off BBC2's The Net) each do 5
         mins on the future in THINGS TO COME (7.55pm, Mon-Fri, C4)
         - Woolley appears to propose "reinventing time", and
         where's that idiot Michael Marshall Smith when you need
         him?... scrub up for the return of ER (9pm, Wed, C4), and
         with rather less fanfare, superior teen soap PARTY OF FIVE
         (6pm, Wed, C4)... another unusual scheduling coincidence
         sees SOS PACIFIC (3.30pm, Thu, C4) on the same day as SOS
         TITANIC (8pm, Thu, C4), while some wag has stuck a HORIZON
         SPECIAL on car crash fatalities (9.30pm, Thu, BBC2) half an
         hour after the opening edition of JEREMY CLARKSON'S EXTREME
         MACHINES (8.30pm, Thu, BBC2)... and with the addition of
         ad-quiz THE BEST SHOW IN THE WORLD - PROBABLY (10.20pm,
         Thu, BBC2), the only thing there isn't a blokey late-night
         game show about is the proliferation of late-night blokey
         game shows - called something like: They Think It's All
         Have I Got Shooting Buzzcocks For You - Or Do They?...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; it's probably the first sci-fi movie in decades to
         acknowledge, spoof and embrace the fact that the entire
         genre is essentially appalling right-wing techno-porn - in
         other words, an entirely accurate film version of
         Heinlein's STARSHIP TROOPERS (imdb: adventure / war /
         action / sci-fi / alien-attack / military / part-animated /
         infantry / space / asteroid / futuristic / fascism / aliens
         / giant-insect / violence / part-computer-animation / gore
         / horror / dismemberment / decapitation / shower). But
         great fun as well as being profoundly disturbing - that
         kind of goes without saying... a laptop-controlled machine
         gun is the only highlight of THE JACKAL (imdb: thriller /
         assassination / russia / mafia / ireland / chase / murder /
         terrorism)... while SPICE WORLD (musical / comedy / music /
         british / concert) is, disappointingly, not a new sequel to
         Frank Herbert's Dune, and also not as good as you thought
         it was going to be when you thought it wasn't going to be
         as bad as you thought, if you know what I mean... on the
         heels of critical acclaim for his costume drama WINGS OF THE
         DOVE (imdb: drama / romance), director Iain "Soft Lad"
         Softley now reckons that his previous movie, Hackers, is
         being reassessed as a "youth cult classic" - well, not
         round here it fucking isn't... in US news, apparently the
         funniest bit of new release MR MAGOO is the disclaimer that
         Disney has added to the credits, after complaints from The
         National Federation For The Blind that "the film does not
         portray people with sight problems in a positive way"...
