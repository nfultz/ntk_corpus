<span class="header">         [Hi, Dave here. Dan's currently visiting the Burning Man
         festival in the Nevada desert and, as he normally does all
         the cool technical stuff, I thought I'd make this a special
</span><span class="quote">         "Reader's Responses" issue, kind of like an FAQ, but
         without the jokes. For the benefit of any new-ish readers,
         I guess I should emphasise that this still isn't the "real"
         weekly Need To Know, which is still on holiday till around
         mid-September. But you know, once you've got a taste for
         sending out this sort of thing on a weekly basis, it's hard
         to give up.]

         [Hi, Dave again. Sorry this is a bit late, but I realised -
         only at the very last minute - that I didn't know the email
         address that I needed to send the finished copy to. See
         what I mean about Danny being the technical one?]

</span><span class="item">         Q. What news would you have done this week then?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A. Hmm, tricky. I quite liked the sound of the Texas
         company with the "theoretically unbreakable" private-key
         email encryption system - who are offering a $1,000,000
         prize to anyone who can crack a brief message in under a
         year ( <a href="http://www.ultimateprivacy.com">www.ultimateprivacy.com</a> ). Be good to see them go up
         against folks like <a href="http://rc5.distributed.net/">http://rc5.distributed.net/</a> ... that
         controversial Basque/pro-ETA terrorist site is back again,
         this time on quite a cool Brit anti-Censorship/PICS site
         ( <a href="http://www.easynet.co.uk/cam/censorship/ehj/ehj.html">www.easynet.co.uk/cam/censorship/ehj/ehj.html</a> )... then
         there was "Whitehouse Sues Matt Drudge For $30 Million" and
         "Netscape To Write All-Java Browser", though technically
         those are both borderline Anti-News (see below)... Danny
         was very keen on some nonsense about someone "patenting"
         the word "Swampy" but I reckoned that was probably a spoof
         - because, right, I can understand that you could register
         it as an official trademark (for loads of cool Swampy
         merchandise) but surely *patenting* would involve proving
         that you had invented the whole idea of a boldly tunnelling
         young man who captured the hearts of a nation... look, it's
         been a slow news week, OK? Microsoft, where were you?
</span><span class="item_space">

</span><span class="item">         Q. What kind of news do you cover?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A. [OK, Dave, I'll take this one - Dan] *Interesting* news.
         We cover a lot of technology/Net stuff (Microsoft vs Apple,
         Microsoft vs Netscape, Microsoft vs Your Mother) because
         our research indicates that NTK subscribers generally a)
         have a computer, b) use the Internet, c) aren't clueless
         newbies who think all of this stuff is  "booring" and
          "unimportant". We cover it from a UK point of view because
         by doing so, as one reader described it, "[you] no longer
         need to get wound up checking over-serious west coast tech
         wank news sites". We do cover other news too - in the past,
         we've written on surveillance, direct action events,
         hacking law, Peter Snow's move to Tomorrow's World,
         censorship, and other geek issues. But mostly, we just
         bleat on about Microsoft. We try to avoid material that's
         covered in the mainstream press - partly because you'll
         have read it before, but mostly because it's completely
         wrong.
</span><span class="item_space">

</span><span class="item">         Q. How do you support it? Why do you do it? Am very
         curious.
                        (- Mike Butcher, News Editor, New Media Age)
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A. Well, we get some support (use of computers, server
         space etc) from our sponsors (see the end of the doc), but
         essentially we do it for the hell of it. We've got about
         700 subscribers so far, and that's not too bad considering
         we haven't done much promotion yet, and are currently on
         holiday. We haven't yet figured out any good ways of making
         any money out of it, but at the moment that doesn't really
         matter - I reckon that because we don't have any charges or
         ads or lame registration systems, we can take on pretty
         much anyone. Like Kevin Spacey says in The Usual Suspects:
         "They realised that to be in power, you didn't need guns or
         money or even numbers. You just needed the *will* to do
         what the other guy wouldn't."

</span><span class="tagline">                              no surprises there
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Q. What are all these other sections about?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A. OK, let's take it bit by bit. First up, Anti-News is
         supposed to be the antithesis of real news, and something
         we thought up once when some PR company sent us a press
         release touting the fact that The Shamen planned to put
         their new single on the Internet. "This isn't news," I
         exclaimed, incredulously. "This, in fact, is its diametric
         opposite. If the Shamen *weren't* releasing their new
         single on the Internet - now that would be news..."
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         So, for instance, among this week's Anti-News would have
         been the remarkable revelation that US net mags are dying
         like flies, with Internet Underground, The Net, NetGuide,
         and "many, many more" either ceasing publication or going
         on indefinite holiday. The best excuse comes from the
         publisher of The Net, who shamefacedly confessed: "We were
         sort of in the position of educating our readership not to
         read the magazine. After 12 issues of the magazine they
         knew enough about the Net so they could get most of what
         they needed online." Damn those pesky readers, eh?

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Q. Pardon?
</span><span class="item_space"> 
</span><span class="item">         A. Yeah, this is like stuff you might want to do that (for
         whatever reason) doesn't involve a computer. Personally,
         I'm hugely excited about this KLF gig at the Barbican on
         Tuesday, but if you can't make it along there, the mighty
         Namco have just opened their latest "fun centre" down in
         the old County Hall building in London (Westminster or
         Waterloo tube, next to the Aquarium), and featuring the
         still hard-to-find (and remarkably excellent) Sega Lost
         World coin-op. NTK says: check it out.
</span><span class="item_space">

</span><span class="item">         Q We've seen what you put in - is there anything you leave
         out?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A Hmm, how about this lively piece of sci-fi rock showbiz
         gossip: "My friend (struggling cartoonist, designer) has
         been commissioned by none other than Gary Numan's manager
         to make a customised loo-seat as a present for Gary Numan's
         forthcoming wedding. It depicts Gary in Star Trek gear
         shooting a Borg with a phaser, as his bride-to-be swoons on
         his arm, dressed in a leather catsuit."

</span><span class="item">         Q. You really don't know anything about this bit, do you
         Dave?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A. Well, no - as round-ups of the latest software/hardware
         upgrades go, it's really not my speciality. Dan said I
         should plug MTU-Speed ("enables you to change the
         appropriate Windows 95 registry settings to maximize your
         speed on downloads... can speed page and file downloads by
         as much as 200 percent just by keeping packet size aligned
         with the transfer unit size"). Well there you have it.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Next Yoz Grahame chips in with "I've found a new web
         scripting language!" Apparently it's called Curl; Yoz
         excitedly adds that it "looks like LISP (what else do you
         expect from MIT?)" and that it may well turn out to be
         "incomprehensible bollocks". You decide.
</span><span class="trailing_urls">         <a href="http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/curl/">http://www.cag.lcs.mit.edu/curl/</a>         
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Then I go and spoil it all with something lame like
         "apparently the Game Boy Pocket is now out in five
         different coloured cases, *including transparent*." Do
         Nintendo know a lot about flogging you the same product

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A. Alright, we got a bit carried away that time, but
         essentially this the latest buzzwords, cool sites and
         random jargon to drop into conversations (or AltaVista,
         whichever is more convenient). This week, among other
         things, I would certainly have plumped for the Teletubbies
         RPG ( <a href="http://www.mhairi.demon.co.uk/ttrpg.htm">www.mhairi.demon.co.uk/ttrpg.htm</a> ), the news that many
         N64 games won't ship till after Christmas ("Analysts say

         Racing game and other major titles do not flop") and, well,
         that MPEG3 clampdown clearly hasn't worked, has it?

</span><span class="item">         I hate to say it, but the word "incompetence" springs to
         mind here. Remember that this is the channel which is
         showing Sabrina reruns when they haven't even finished
         showing the first run yet: there are still five unscreened
         episodes left over from the run which finished in April.
         They've also taken to censoring it: the "whammy fanny" song
         lyrics have been cut out.

         should also look forward to for the eventual TV debut of
         the Buffy The Vampire Slayer spin-off series, which is
         almost exactly the same show, yet - incredibly - cuter and
         more terrifying BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; Sunday is BBC2 night, with STEPHEN HAWKING'S UNIVERSE
         (7.45pm) leading up to the often entertaining OUTER LIMITS
         (8.35pm), some stuff about bullying, then the wildly
         underrated Winona Ryder movie REALITY BITES (10.10pm) -
         tough competition for Tim Robbins as THE HUDSUCKER PROXY
         (10pm, Sun, C4)... funny TV ads from other countries form
         the highly original premise of RORY MCGRATH'S COMMERCIAL
         BREAKDOWN (9.30pm, Tue, BBC1)... yet another relaunch for
         clunky old TOMORROW'S WORLD (7.30pm, Wed, BBC1), now hosted
         Scully-and-Mulder-style by Philippa Forester and Peter
         Snow... still, the real X FILES are back (Wed, 9.30pm,
         BBC1) with really quite a dull bee-keeping cliffhanger; we
         prefer the repeats of SLIDERS (6.45pm, Wed/Thu, BBC2)...
         oh, and most people would surely rather spend 10 years in a
         futuristic prison than have to endure the similarly themed
         tedium of NO ESCAPE (11.15pm, Thu, BBC1)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES&gt;&gt; it's pretty much CONSPIRACY THEORY (action /
         thriller / conspiracy / computers) vs THE FULL MONTY
         (comedy / stripper)... Conspiracy Theory has Mel Gibson,
         Julia Roberts, Patrick "Picard" Stewart, direction from
         Richard "Lethal Weapon" Donner, and some nice references,
         but ultimately a bit confused... The Full Monty is some
         unemployed blokes (including the guy off Hamish Macbeth)
         turning to erotic dancing; funnier than you'd think, but
         not exactly undermining the theory that British cinema now
         just means costume drama and smut comedies...

         forthcoming spin-off print publication of Need To Know

         event of another publication contesting our claim to be
         "Britain's Most Sarcastic Weekly Technology News E-zine",
         NTK will partially retract the statement by claiming that,
         the phrase, in itself, is intended to be sarcastic.
         Logically, this therefore makes us the most sarcastic
         again, and so on, to infinity.

         Q. What about Doug Hofstadter's research group in Indiana?
