</span><span class="item">         Only one week to go before the ceremonial unveiling of the 
         radically new redesigned NTK (which means, by the usual scheme 
         of things, only 3 weeks to go before everyone complains that 
         they don't like it and we're shamefacedly forced to go back to 
         the old one). But if you reckon yourself as some sort of 
         "graphic designer" (or even if you don't), then why not enter 
         the Official NTK DRILY IRONIC T-SHIRT COMPETITION ? Clearly 
         far more than just an attempt to come up with some decent 
         merchandising without having to design it all ourselves, the 
         prizes, in keeping with NTK's pioneering "c2c" business model, 
         will be cafepress.com-style royalties from *every* shirt we 
         eventually sell with your design on it, which is more than 
         "Blue Peter" ever coughed up. Content-wise, you don't have to 
         specifically promote NTK - though you may use NTK slogans like 
         the snappy "They stole our revolution - now we're stealing it 
         back", "In-jokes for outcasts", or "Will consult for food" - 
         and can advocate anything else you think other NTK readers 
         might like instead: pr0n, warez, or self-referential humour, 
         for instance. We prefer to receive URLs rather than gigantic 
         TIFFs, .pngs, or (shudder) .bmps, and, as in the final game of 
         "Rollerball", we're setting *no time limit* for this contest 
         (though obviously the sooner you get us stuff, the sooner 
         you'll be making $$$!) - the competition will continue until 
         we are entirely sated by the entries received, or until 
         everyone involved is dead.

</span><span class="item">         We were under the impression that the link between upcoming 
         "This Life" web-designing drama ATTACHMENTS and its associated 
         young people's website was supposed to be a secret, so people 
         might discover the groovy site first and then be pleasantly 
         surprised that it was something to do with those squares at 
         the BBC. And, indeed, it took someone with "root permissions" 
         to blow the gaffe on this one: JANE ROOT, that is, controller 
         of BBC2, who told the Guardian on Monday that the site should 
         "feel as though it has been created by the fictional 
         characters from the drama". Of course, it's actually been 
         constructed, right down to some of the songs on the site, by 
         Mr "Smoother And Faster" himself, the multi-talented DAVID 
         MCCANDLESS [see numerous NTKs passim]. Drama in the show will 
         come from conflict between the creatives and the suits, which 
         will ideally be reflected off-screen - for instance: what will 
         the BBC make of what (we suspect) may be modified, cutting-
         edge content ideas from Macca's long-mooted "cool technology 
         lifestyle mag", turned down by Dennis after they got their 
         fingers burned with "Escape"? Stay tuned, viewers, stay tuned!

         COKEAUCTION site was, at time of writing, closed due to 
         "technical difficulties". Ah, that'd be the numerous lots 
         that, earlier this morning, were featuring bids of 9,999,990 
         points (no pictorial evidence, sorry) which, at the current 
         exchange rate, implied those users had drunk (and redeemed) 
         99,999 cans of coke, each, over the last few weeks. We know 
         net users enjoy a caffeinated soft-drink from time to time,

         Cinema, at 6.45pm on Sun 2000-09-03. As well as a 40 minute 
         preview of upcoming releases, "in-game characters such as 
         Sonic, Ulala and the SoulCalibur fighters will be in 
         attendance to pose for pictures and distribute free Dreamcast 
         drinks and popcorn" - popcorn that everyone will, of course, 
         politely refuse, just in case Sony and Microsoft bring out 
         something better in 18 months' time.

         '80s sci-fi SATURN 3 (11.45pm, Fri, BBC1)... but things start 
         picking up with John Carpenter's "It's a megablast" ASSAULT ON 
         PRECINCT 13 (9.55pm, Sat, BBC2)... plus Cuba Gooding Jr's 
         post-apocalyptic AIDS-drama DAYBREAK (1am, Sat, ITV) offering 
         a healthier alternative to Bowie's interminably arty THE MAN 
         WHO FELL TO EARTH (12.05am, Sat, BBC2)... the BBC seems 
         inexplicably pleased over acquiring those agonisingly 
         protracted 50-min episodes of THUNDERBIRDS (5.25pm, Sun, 
         BBC2)... ELIZABETH (9pm, Sun, C4) is essentially a pointless 
         prequel to "Shakespeare In Love", but without Gwyneth Paltrow 
         or any of the gags... making film of the weekend the "Scary

         set off on THE SEARCH FOR KURTZ (11.05pm, Sat; 1.05am, Mon,

         superhero MAX STEEL (4.15pm, Tue, ITV) - from the makers of 
         "Starship Troopers: The Animated Series"... no boring old 
         political context gets in the way of documentary "Who Dares 
         Wins"-style thrills in Olympics hostage face-off ONE DAY IN 
         SEPTEMBER (9pm, Tue, BBC2)... an ill-judged attempt to splice 
         the DNA of "The X Files" and "Dawson's Creek" produce pallid, 
         unviable hybrid ROSWELL HIGH (6pm, Thu, BBC2)... while it'll 
         be interesting to see if all the Jamie Oliver-style everyday

         strong violence and coarse language) - seriously, it looks 
         like a remake of his first film intercut with bits of "Fight 
         Club" - and not in a good way... Neil "In The Company Of Men" 
         LaBute returns with what could be his very own "Cable Guy", in 
         wackily cast too-much-TV weirdness NURSE BETTY (MPAA: Rated R 
         for strong violence, pervasive language and a scene of 
         sexuality) - at last, a feature-length version of that 
         "Friends" episode where Brooke Shields thinks Joey is his soap 
         character... while the arthouse selection includes: Saffron 
         "Wing Commander" Burrows in class-obsessed sexual potboiler

         IDAHO (imdb: siamese-twins / independent-film); or, what could 
         be the "Caligula" for the 21st century, Shakespeare adaptation 
         TITUS (<a href="http://www.cndb.com">http://www.cndb.com</a> : "a lengthy look at [Alan

         upcoming Sky sitcom of the same name... so you may as well 
         hold on for the Thursday previews of intermittently hilarious 
         scatological "Scream" spoof SCARY MOVIE, which, as if any 
         further recommendation was required, is only the second (out 
         of 320 "analysed") to earn the prized <a href="http://www.capalert.com">http://www.capalert.com</a> 
         rating of zero, thanks to: admission and impudence at sexual 
         immorality; portrayal of a stuffed monkey masturbating; 
         repeated shots of grossly exaggerated male scrotum; 81 minutes 
         of wanton licentious disregard for righteousness, moral 
         character and inhibition; defiance of rules of courtesy;

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CONFECTIONERY THEORY&gt;&gt; dedicated biscuiteers have slammed our 
         award of the spotting-credit on the TWIX TOP to Matt "Creme 
         Egg Guy" Lucas [NTK 2000-08-11]: "Limited sampling, my hairy 
         arse," frothed JAMES O'BRIEN, "[They've] been available for 
         months - I've bought them from Tesco in Covent Garden and 
         Safeway in Acton," eventually calming himself with the thought 
         that "something about the wrapper design, coupled with the 
         overall biscuit shape, brings to mind non-wacky 60's 
         packaging"... "[the] buggers were on sale in the Peterborough 
         branch of Asda at least a month ago," concurred DANIEL 
         THORNTON. "I would've mentioned it, but they looked bland as a 
         bland thing"... while JOHN CHANDLER leapt to the newcomer's 
         defence, describing it as "a flattened, inverted Twix. Heavy 
         on the biscuit, skimpy on the chocolate and caramel" - mildly 
         preferable to our analogy with the baboon that goes through 
         the teleporter in "The Fly", and comes out all inside-out. 
         "I've been eating them since the middle of last year, roughly 
         one every work day (two if there's a code deadline)," John 
         confides. "However, the only source appears to be a local 
         Tesco, bizarrely - I can only presume it's to make up for 
         living in an area where no ADSL or Cable is planned for the 
         next 50 years". What, John - you mean the United Kingdom?... 
         STEVE CORNISH conceded that the Twix Top "sounds crap", but is 
         in fact "very addictive", before going on to correct MARK 
         SAVAGE's theory [also NTK 2000-08-11] that Maltesers were 
         "just chocolate coated Horlicks powder". "Years ago, Mars used 
         to buy their malt from Horlicks," Steve recalls, "but Horlicks 
         allegedly pumped up the price too much." How *do* those people 
         sleep at night?... nothing too exciting on the shelves right 
         now - UNCLE BEN'S RISPINOS "Mini-Rice-Snacks" (59p/packet), 
         effectively duplicate the giant sugar-puff sensation of rival 
         Quaker's "Snack A Jacks" [NTK 2000-07-04], while KELLOGG'S 
         have at last got their act together with the CHOCOLATE CARAMEL 
         RICE KRISPIES SQUARES (about 30p), which taste like a proper 
         Rice Krispie cake, but with molten chocolate dribbled all over 
         it... still, a bunch of new brands to look out for, including: 
         independent Milky-Way market-entrant LOVELLS' MILKY LUNCH 
         (25p); Anthea Turner-endorsed Antipodean arrival SNOWFLAKE 
         (UKP1.85 on front of this week's OK MAGAZINE, full roll-out 
         due Sep 11); the appalling sounding WONKA WONKALATE (25p, out 
         now) - a "purple, raspberry-flavoured bar with green 
         'snozzberry' flavour nerds [which] spell out the name Wonka"; 
         plus NESTLE's rapid response to the "Campini" threat emanating 
         from the makers of Werther's Originals, strawberry and cream-
         flavoured POLO SMOOTHIES (99p/packet, out now)...
