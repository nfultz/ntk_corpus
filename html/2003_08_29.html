         anything. Which is was good news for the four hundred very
         sane demonstrators that went to Brussels this week to
         complain about the imminent adoption of software patents.
         While the banners - and, yes, mimes - clustered outside, the
         more besuited free software advocates nipped in to alert 
         MEPs to the freedom-crippling nature of the evil they were
         about to unleash. Whatever they said, it was enough to get
         the Europarliament to withdraw Arlene McCarthy's pro-patent
         report and postpone discussion of the topic until the JURI
         committe has reconsidered their approach. As Irish
         campaigner Ciaran O'Riordan notes, the original report only
         nipped through the committee with a 64% vote, so there's a
         chance that some MEPs can be turned around to get the idea
         of software patents thrown out of Europe for good.

</span><span class="item">         What is about the Irish and their bolshy upstart
         actually-doing-something-about-the-problem ways? A bit
         confused about why they were supposed to be handing blood
         money to SCO for the One True Linux License, the IRISH LINUX
         USER'S GROUP have not idly sat back. They've been pestering
         SCO Ireland for an accurate description of what they're
         forking out for. And if SCO can't come up with one? Why,
         they're going to take them to the Irish equivalent of the
         Trading Standards people. Of course, not all of Ireland
         feels the same way: as subscriber JONATHAN BAKER-BATES
         notes, Dublin band The Thrills have apparently taken SCO's
         side with their "Santa Cruz" hit. The song commiserates with
         Santa Cruz against the "august [free software] cowboys",
         who, they say "stole your style [of C commenting and
         indentation]". Whether SCO's "train [of legal papers]" will
         indeed "roll in on time" might well be up to other Linux
         users kicking up a similiar fuss.

</span><span class="item">         Thanks for all your suggestions to alleviate the commuter 
         misery that is NATIONAL RAIL ENQUIRIES' online timetable. 
         PETER MARTIN was one of several to praise the Teutonic 
         efficiency of the national German rail site (available in 
         entirely accent-free English, too), but only ANDREW DANCY 
         noted that "the old [Railtrack] site lives on in the form of 
         the Wandsworth Council travel planner", believed to use "the 
         same data as the old Railtrack timetable site", which 
         presumably originates from the German state railway, Deutsche 
         Bahn again. Lone accessibility re-arranger MATTHEW SOMERVILLE 
         has prepared his own "*very* rough first draft" rework of the 
         National Rail site and, while nonetheless intrigued by the 
         German and Wandsworthian versions, claimed that "they all give 
         different answers", before being distracted by the fact that 
         nothing was being done about the BT directory enquiries site. 
         And still the crimes against usability trickle in, this week's 
         most ironic being CAM MESIAS' spotting of ACCENTURE CAREERS' 
         "Global Meritocracy Statement", explaining how they do not 
         discriminate on the basis of "non-disqualifying physical or 
         mental disability" - in a JavaScript pop-up window.

         what is now regarded as one of the primitive predecessors of 
         the SID chip, the piano. In short, it should be something of 
         an eye-opener even if you're not as much of a Commodore 
         devotee as reader MAT FLETCHER, who objected to our recent 
         mention of the Vic-20 "heyday of the 20-column text adventure" 
         with the succinct correction: "22 dear boy, not 20! That would 
         have been unbearable!"

         .phoenix/[foo]/[blah]/chrome/ we've really not had much problem
         with ads on the Net. But if you're stuck with IE or want to
         fine-tune your control over cookies and pop-ups, it'd be remiss
         of us not to (finally) mention PRIVOXY - the filtering Web proxy
         for MacOSX, Unixes, and Windows. It's all very simple: you
         install the program with a couple of clicks, type in the magic
         127.0.0.1 numbers into your browser's proxy settings, and Privoxy
         will strip out anything that looks dodgy, from banner ads to
         nasty javascript. Privoxy has a wide range of built-in actions,
         from replacing ads with a customised graphics to sending rude
         messages in the headers of your Webpage requests. Apart from a
         barely noticeable delay at the start of every Webpage (which we
         now regret even mentioning to you), Privoxy is as good as
         invisible - and so are the ads. Install it, and undermine the
         precarious economy of new media today!

         you can now express your dismay with our latest co-production 
         t-shirt: 10 PRINT "RETRO GAMES ARE SHIT" 20 GOTO 10, currently 
         on sale at <a href="http://www.ntkmart.com/">http://www.ntkmart.com/</a> for just 10.00 pounds Earth 
         money. Also new this month: a sort of handwritten IF I HAD A 
         LIFE I WOULDN'T BE HERE (a bit like the scene where "help me" 
         appears on the kid's skin in "The Exorcist"), and the first 
         official merchandising from acclaimed dance music education 
         establishment THE MUSEUM OF TECHNO - UKP2.00 from each sale

         and Andy Brice's THAT'S WEIRD - IT WORKS ON MY MACHINE has 
         sold out again, though fans of his work may also enjoy his 
         Demotivators-But-Without-The-Sarcastic-Tagline-style digital 
         photo prints available from <a href="http://www.andybrice.com/">http://www.andybrice.com/</a> ... a 
         reassuringly deranged selection of reader designs, as ever, 
         with DAN DUKESON's "uck SC" being perhaps the most topical 
         <a href="http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/images/uckSC.png">http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/images/uckSC.png</a> , and TOM DE 
         MULDER's selection at <a href="http://www.furrfu.org/t-shirtideas/">http://www.furrfu.org/t-shirtideas/</a> the 
         most prolific, though our "Do I look like a people person?" 
         favourite is quite a popular t-shirt slogan already, we fear. 
         AMANDA STONE kept the text-only entries self-referential with 
         "ceci|n'est|pas|une|pipe", DANNY JONES mused "How many 
         Slashdotters could Slashdot Slashdot if Slashdot could be 
         Slashdotted?", and only ANDREW SMITH and MARTIN RODGERS let 
         the side down with their not-particularly-subversive screen 
         grab <a href="http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/images/assteroids.gif">http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/images/assteroids.gif</a> and 
         "Colour coordinated chroma-coding is *so* gay" (in "black text 
         on a white shirt"), respectively. LLOYD WOOD accurately 
         anticipated we'd like some slogans having a go at bloggers, 
         suggesting "Blogging - good! Journalism - bad! Bandwagons - 
         excellent!" and "WE ARE THE BLOGS. JOURNALISM IS FUTILE. YOU 
         WILL BE ANNOTATED", but we're still interested in variations 
         on this theme (or indeed our own "Does my ass look fact-
         checked in this?")... "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get 
         One Free" entries were particularly disappointing this month, 
         with DAVE PHELAN pathetically listing 3 missed opportunities 
         to have flaunted one during the blanket coverage of Brighton's 
         PiertoPier wifi network <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/3068915.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/3068915.stm</a> , 
         so the winner has to be to TV's IAIN LEE for wearing an 
         "Elite" shirt during "Big Brother's Little Brother" in July on 
         Channel 4 <a href="http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/images/">http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/images/</a> . Iain receives a 
         free t-shirt of his choice if he (or someone pretending to be 
         him) would like to get in touch to claim it - please email
