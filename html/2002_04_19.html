</span><span class="item">         Nice to see the Inland Revenue getting into this whole "open
         government" policy. But really, there's no need to be so
         subtle. If you truly want everyone to see the edits to your
         Budget press releases, there's no need to hide it by
         uploading Word files with the previous deleted revisions
         casually left in. After all, if you wanted everyone to know
         that the suspiciously Old Labour phrase "ensure the nation
         receives a fair share of the profits from the exploitation
         of the North Sea" was edited out by a Treasury civil servant
         at the last minute, and replaced with "the North Sea fiscal
         regime does not strike the right balance between promoting
         investment and taking an adequate share of revenue derived
         from a national resource", tell us outright! It's no fun
         ploughing through all the Treasury word files you left on
         the site, turning on the "Confirm Revisions" option, and
         spotting the Sir Humphrey fixes for ourselves, is it?

</span><span class="item">         It's only when you see all the main combatants piled into
         the same room at the COMPUTERS FREEDOM AND PRIVACY
         CONFERENCE that you realise just how dirty the copyright
         wars have become. Itinerant EFF reps, ricocheting from LA's
         Copy Protection Technology Working Group, struggling with
         the culture-shock: blank-faced Hollywood apparatchiks
         plotting the downfall of open computing there, geeks
         open-mouthed with horror here. Pro-DMCAer Allan Adler of the
         Association of American Publishers inadvertedly spurring
         everyone on by declaiming that the audience had "no right to
         access copyrighted material" - even copyrighted material in
         their own homes. Some other IP stooge backtracking from the
         mob by stating that the US just *had* to introduce the DMCA
         because of "international treaties". (Well, that's odd: they
         tell us the neoDMCA proposals in the EC is there because the
         US did it first.) Phil Zimmermann, patient as ever, trying
         to break it to the media barons that the software industry
         *tried* this copy protection lark back in the Eighties and
         if it didn't work for Leisure Suit Larry, it won't work for
         "Blade II". John Perry Barlow, so shocked and upset he
         starts talking sense. And the more the CFPers confer, the
         more they seemed to realise that Hollywood is going for the
         hat-trick: taking away freedom, privacy *and* computers.
         Pretty impressive. But only if they manage it.

</span><span class="item">         Forced to relocate to a pub after an administrative mixup over
         the bank offices they'd been hoping to use, last Saturday's
         first public meeting of the UK's ASSOCIATION FOR FREE SOFTWARE
         offered something for everyone: beer, pizza, and an expertly
         crafted mix of practical decision-making and drunken shouting.
         As the name suggests, the group plan to support and promote
         Free Software (ie, GNU *and* Linux) to the likes of schools,
         voluntary organisations, business federations, local
         government and the media - but that's "free" as in "freedom",
         not "free" as in "we currently think the membership fee will
         be UKP10 annually". And, just to liven things up at the end,
         the shouting came courtesy of a heated debate over software
         patents - not over whether they're a bad thing (they are,
         apparently), but over exactly how stringently the AFFS - and
         bemused pub locals - should oppose them, with (as ever)
         those who'd had the most recent contact with Richard Stallman
         feeling the uncontrollable urge to prove themselves more
         ideologically uncompromising than everyone else.

         Omid "The Mummy" Djalili appears on the leaflet but has had to
         pull out, hopefully not because of publicity commitments for
         "The Scorpion King".

         On an Xterm! In a text browser! JPEGs and GIFs and PNGs! So

         Violet Berlin/Gareth Jones: <a href="http://www.whizzbang.tv/">http://www.whizzbang.tv/</a> ... in
         accordance with our suggestion of 2001-07-06, ALISTAIR
         MCGOWAN'S BIG IMPRESSION (8.30pm, Fri, BBC1) features "When
         Ruby Wax Met Louis Theroux" - but no Jon Ronson?... and Sarah
         Michelle Gellar is stranded on a desert island in BEVERLY
         HILLS FAMILY ROBINSON (5.15pm, Sat, C5), then the inevitable
         "The Matrix"-style episode of BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (8pm,
         Thu, Sky1)... Al "Pub Landlord" Murray introduces TOP TEN TV
         BASTARDS (10.20pm, Sat, C4)... BBC2 continues trying to up the
         viewing figures with 3 more back-to-back repeats of 24 (11pm,
         Sat, BBC2) - can't wait till the series is over, then they can
         show them all "in real time" one day... and Charlton Heston

         group and interests in post-biowar shootout THE OMEGA MAN

         with real problems, like the Mad-Max-esque car-dwelling petrol
         scavengers of WASTED? (8.05pm, Sun, C4)... while Alicia

         and it looks like Guy Pearce really has suffered a knock to
         the head as he follows top-notch noirs like "Memento" and "LA
