</span><span class="item">         MICROSOFT responded to last week's court ruling (that they
         should unbundle Internet Explorer and Windows 95) with all
         the care and attention of their own technical support
         staff. First, they denied it was possible. Then they said,
         airily, that you *could* try and delete the Explorer files,
         but that would probably crash the OS: they really weren't
         sure. Finally, they grudgingly suggested formatting the
         hard disk and re-installing the original (Summer 1995)
         version of Win '95. Maybe that'll work, they said. Given
         Microsoft's clear intention to wind up the DOJ (and their
         superlative experience at doing that to everyone else), we
         were hoping for something a little more creative. Maybe
         they should deny that Windows '95 is an OS at all, but a
         "special sort of Internet Explorer for hard drives".
         Scarily, that's close to what MS seem to be saying about
         Windows '98: it and IE4.0, they say, are essentially the
         same thing. Which is interesting when you remember that
         Microsoft also promised that Explorer would be always be
         free. Wow! Free Windows! It's what we always wanted!
</span><span class="trailing_urls">         <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/971218/tech/stories/browser_2.html">www.yahoo.com/headlines/971218/tech/stories/browser_2.html</a>
                   - well, we'd have preferred socks, but never mind
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Of course the point at which it'll get truly scary is when
         the DOJ announces a "strategic partnership agreement" with
         Gates to "develop and improve... the legislative process".
         This inevitably happens to any enemy of MICROSOFT,
         generally four months just before they disappear entirely.
         SGI's just announced such a deal over OpenGL++, or
         FAHRENHEIT, as the co-development is now called. Presumably
         the name is meant to convey the chilly reception SGI's die-
         hard fans gave it - or perhaps it's a hint to HP (who
         thought *they* were doing the 3D stuff for Microsoft) that
         they're now out in the cold. Or maybe it's just a reference
         to those OpenGL developers now burning their old manuals at
         451 degrees, and trying to learn the new order.
</span><span class="trailing_urls">         <a href="http://www.sgi.com/">http://www.sgi.com/</a> hold on, didn't we run this deal last week?
         <a href="http://www.apple.com/">http://www.apple.com/</a>              or the time before that?

</span><span class="item">         Bill Clinton - the US President, equivalent of the Queen in
         this country - signed the "NO ELECTRONIC THEFT ACT" this
         week. The new law closed the loophole that let Americans
         give away copies of copyrighted data even if they didn't
         make a profit out of it (refusing to profiteer is already a
         capital offence in most American states). Now the tricky
         part: enforcement. Latest copy protection to unravel: the
         Digital Watermarking system in PHOTOSHOP. Look out for
         un%ign, a cross-platform utility to remove those
         watermarks, including the "Adult picture" rating flags.
         Even more mischievous, cracker Frogs_Print's new Photoshop
         patch allows perps to replace the original copyright with
         their own, letting them sue those capitalists right back.

         Disneyworld - Florida tourists were warned it was "not an
         attraction"; a virulent Hong Kong contagion crossed the
         species barrier from CHICKENS to humans; NINTENDO denied
         responsibility for an anime show that triggered epileptic
         seizures in 600 Japanese children; and a METEOR blasted a
         15 megaton crater in the heart of Greenland. That's the

         make of that? Well, the secret's out: UK Citizens Online
         Democracy (UKCOD) have set up a site (in loose co-operation
         with the govt) to collect submissions from the public on
         the new White Paper. It's only until 11/2/98 - which is
         why, technically, it's an event. Yeah, we know, but it's
         actually quite a smart site, with a lot of impartial data
         on the proposals, chats with the relevant officials, and a
         respectable mail/Web discussion forum. It'd be nice if the
         FOI Act didn't mess up completely, and judging by the DTI's
         similar set-up with their crypto proposals, these sites can
         at least serve as a source of acute embarrassment when they
         try to ignore the collected opinions. Which they will. Oh,

         20 meg tease and a 13 meg trail for STAR WARS EPISODE I,

         film, there are unconfirmed reports that Liam Neeson "stormed

         in this series of FRASIER (10pm, Fri, C4), though "He'll be
         back" - in two weeks... the only way we can describe LEXX:
         THE DARK ZONE STORIES (12.10am, Fri, C5) is - "like Dune
         remade by the people who did Space Precinct so as to
         resemble an unofficial sequel to Blake's 7" - but in a good
         way, of course... rivalling even previous bizarro theme
         nights, the evening devoted to the choices (and output) of
         cross-dressing comic EDDIE IZZARD (9pm, Sat, C4) includes
         Woody Allen's hit-and-miss sci-fi spoof SLEEPER (11.55pm,
         Sat, C4) and hopefully the cracking "best of" episode of
         KIDS IN THE HALL (11.10pm, Sat, C4)... Doug Trumbull's
         proto-Strange Days VR-thriller BRAINSTORM (11.45pm, Sat,
         BBC2) is actually far better than Strange Days but, then
         again, *what isn't*? - a theme intriguingly echoed by the
         CHARLIE BROWN AND SNOOPY SHOW (11.20am, Sun, BBC2) in which
         "the kids go to a computer camp where the games come to
         life" (Radio Times)... <a href="http://www.dianabear.com">www.dianabear.com</a> won't be appearing
         in the first of many docus wallowing in MEMORIES OF DIANA
         (6.30pm, Sun, BBC1)... it's hard to imagine the horror of
         being trapped on board Mir day after day after day - well,
         that is until you've heard "Brit-born" astronaut Michael
         Foale go on about it for an hour on EQUINOX (9pm, Mon,
         C4)... Phil Cornwell's impressions of ageing celebs on
         STELLA STREET (11.15pm, Mon-Tue, BBC2) should be tragically
         less funny than his Steve Wright show stuff... bunk off
         early for the cool sci-fi F/X compilation of MOVIE MAGIC:
         FINAL FRONTIER (3.10pm, Tue, ITV) - probably a big
         improvement on Harrison Ford yawn-athon CLEAR AND PRESENT
         DANGER (9.30pm, Tue, BBC1)... Xmas Eve taunts devotees of
         the Formulaic Film Titles Of Steven Spielberg, with RAIDERS
         OF THE LOST ARK (2.50pm, Wed, BBC1) vs CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF
         THE THIRD KIND (2.05pm, Wed, ITV)... Drebin is back (just
         accept it) in NAKED GUN 33 1/3 (9pm, Wed, BBC1), while
         MODERN TIMES (9pm, Wed, BBC2) plays with toys... on the big
         day itself, the MUPPET CHRISTMAS CAROL (3.10pm, ITV, Thu)
         and THE MASK (6.50pm, Thu, BBC1) are the best of the
         regular kiddie-crap (The Flintstones? Honey I Shrunk The
         Kids? Home Alone 2???)... and C4 continues its 15th-
         anniversary retrospective with A SPLICE OF LIFE (10.15pm,
         Thu, C4), featuring clips from seasonal Film On Four fare
         like Shallow Grave, The Crying Game, The Madness Of King
         George and - of course - Trainspotting...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE (imdb: comedy / jungle / based-
         on-cartoon / based-on-tv-series) is perhaps the least
         despicable of this week's child-oriented offerings, with
         Brendan "Encino Man" Fraser imitating the tree-slamming
         doofus originally devised by Jay Ward Productions - who
         also made Rocky And Bullwinkle, Tom Slick, Peabody's
         Improbable History, yet astonishingly *not* Roger Ramjet or
         Batfink... uh-oh: crypto-Arthurian romp PRINCE VALIANT
         (imdb: adventure / based-on-comic) is an UK/ Irish/ German
         co-production and features characters called "Pechet" and
         "Thagnar"... it's got four villains instead of two, and may
         yet be the best Home Alone movie ever made - but still take
         care stepping over the threshold of HOME ALONE 3 (MPAA
         rated: PG for "slapstick violence, language and mild
         sensuality" - whatever *that* means)... in other movie
         news, MEN OF CRISIS is a recently uncovered 1971 Woody
         Allen short that satirises the Nixon government - as Film
         Threat Weekly reports: "unlike his last 15 movies, the film
         DOES NOT feature a sub-plot about Allen involved in a May-
         September romance"...
