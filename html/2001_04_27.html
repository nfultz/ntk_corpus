</span><span class="item">         If the RIAA is so keen to remunerate working musicians, why
         doesn't it pay mariachi bands to drown out academic seminars
         it doesn't want heard? It'd do as much good as the legal
         threats they're directing against anyone who speaks on the
         Secure Digital Media Initiative's weaknesses - and, may, we
         think, add a much needed air of calm and dignity to the
         RIAA's thrashing. The RIAA's requirement that this week's
         conference - on "Information Hiding" - destroy all evidence
         of one of their sessions, was cringingly misplaced. And
         their apparent amazement that people were using zipfiles
         (the MP3s of scienze dudez) to "hide" the secret information
         of the evil researchers all over the Net was just
         embarrassing. What did they think was going to happen? That
         the authors of the squelched paper would shut down the
         pirate sites until they agreed to pay as dearly for their
         freedoms as the scientific community is right now?

</span><span class="item">         Weirdly, the media seem to have some sort of vested interest
         in claiming that next Tuesday's MAYDAY MONOPOLY festivities
         have been extensively infiltrated and distorted by ultra-
         violent agitators (and they don't mean "the police"!). Given
         this, it's odd they're not encouraging people to pursue more
         non-violent ways of protesting - "hacktivist" website
         defacing, for example - especially as this currently poses
         no particular threat compared to any other time of the year,
         according to such noted and credible experts as DK Matai of
         mi2g, who previously warned of "hackers precipitating Y2K
         chaos by setting PC clocks forward" [see NTKs passim].
         Handily enough, many new Windows 2000 users are even
         labouring under "a false sense of security", as Graeme
         Pinkney, of security firm Activis told THE REGISTER this
         week; ah, mused shadowy exploit-watchers THE DATA AND
         NETWORK SECURITY COUNCIL, that must be why Activis are
         running a notably old version of Microsoft's
         tried-and-tested IIS4 on their public webserver.

</span><span class="item">         Not unexpected news on that LEONARD CHESHIRE [NTK
         2001-03-09] case. We always suspected that the disabled
         "interventionist artists" running this anti-institutional
         site might not get to keep the domain. Handy tip to
         domain-activists: offering to sell the domain back to the
         Complainant for forty grand looks bad to the WIPO, even if
         you're offering the site as a work of art, and plan to spend
         the cash on a disabled holocaust memorial. However, it *is*
         good to report that even as the WIPO passed the domain back,
         all the other leonard cheshire domains were snapped up by
         other disability activists with more activism planned. We at
         least suspect this group of subversive net.artists might not
         use inaccessible frames and bloody Flash everywhere.

</span><span class="item">         With their consistent indentation, neat modularisation, and
         smarmy little Changelogs, even the suckiest open source
         package makes an effort to be neat, clean and bug-free. And
         by doing so, they say to "we live on a great old planet
         that's W3C-diddly-Python perfect!" But let's be honest. Who
         *really* scratches itches like that? Where are those freaky
         scripts that gaffer our tattered pants to our sorry arses?
         Those crazy, home-grown ideas, project-managed by Dr
         Bourbon, with a deadline of dawn and a jeering audience of
         one? You know damn well where they are - hiding at the
         bottom of your ~/bin directory where no-one will ever see
         them. Well, friend, JOEY RAMONE did not DIE so that FREE
         SOFTWARE could become BOGGED DOWN in GLOSSY LIFELESS
         PRODUCTION VALUES. Of that we can be certain. It's time you
         sent your three-chord executables to DUMBCODE, the site
         expressly designed to foster the stupid side of coding. It's
         the moshpit freshmeat: processes that live fast, die young,
         and leave zombies. Code that chroot jail's too good for. An
         open source project that you don't have to wait "until I've
         got time to document the features", because you ain't going
         to do it - and we like you the way you are. Dumb.

         THE NICK OF TIME (10.05am, Sat, BBC2) follows "a piece of
         legislation forced through Brussels in record time that helped
         Europe keep up with the Internet" (Radio Times)... SF:UK
         (1.15am, Sat, C4) talks to Anthony "C3P0" Daniels as well as
         Grant Morrison on his attempt to bring back "Dan Dare"... and,
         in a wildly disturbing new trend, "Casualty" actors help out
         an actual A&amp;E ward in CASUALTY: GET REAL (9.05pm, Sat, BBC1) -
         next week, Robbie Coltrane helps police psychologists profile
         a sex killer!... an "edited for nudity" LOGAN'S RUN (2.45pm,
         Sun, BBC2) gets its second showing since Dec 1999 - one
         solution to the plague of OAP criminals depicted in CUTTING

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CONFECTIONERY THEORY&gt;&gt; first up, apologies to T-shirt
         purchasers who received a bafflingly unsolicited email from
         our e-commerce associates CyberCandy this week, which has now
         been traced to a misguided attempt to clarify the workings of
         their opt-in update newsletter which they hadn't realised had
         lost its opt-out button when they upgraded their shopping cart
         software. Nonetheless, measures are being put in place to make
         it slightly more difficult for NTK readers to purchase sweets
         from them in future, to ensure that this sort of thing neither
         goes unpunished nor ever happens again... anyway, not too
         much to report in the basic sugar/chocolate department: an
         anonymous source close to MARS observed that the "KIT-KAT
         BALLS" spotted in NTK 2001-03-30 more accurately fit the
         description of MALTESERS TEASERS, possibly to be launched with
         a new Mars logo as part of "a vigorous marketing operation
         from September"... while frozen comestibles enthusiast TOBY
         "I led the great 1999 revolt against Calippo Shots" SLATER
         described his initial encounter with WALLS' CORNETTO WHIPPY as
         "a disappointment: the ice cream is nothing like Mr Whippy
         (it's pretty much solid and *even more* synthetic-tasting than
         its namesake)", and the enclosed chocolate bar bears "no
         resemblance whatsoever to a Flake", more resembling a "five-
         month-old offcut of Aero"... while another nameless tip-off
         alleged that VIRGIN are due to launch "a 5-strong range of
         dirty, Panda Cola flavoured rainbow coloured drinks, called V
         COLOURS", and featuring "herbal extracts". Apparently, they
         "all taste like shit"... other liquids to look out for include
         ailing COCA-COLA'S attempts to expand into non-carbonated
         beverages - a 500ml wide-mouth plastic bottle for OASIS and
         new "still fruit drink" ALIVE - and ROWNTREE's 200g DRINKING
         YOGHURT (UKP 1.59 for pack of 4); we prefer "Peach, Orange and
         Apricot" over the artificial sweetener-alike "Strawberry",
         plus it comes in a dinky little bottle that you can swig from
         as if you were nonchalantly abusing cough medicine... but the
         real action this month has been in spicy versions of savoury
         snacks - JAKE LINGWOOD thought WALKERS FUNYUNS (27p) were
         "good, in a sort of Onion Rings meets Skips sort of way", and
         thus his "favourite new extruded corn snack", though, when
         challenged over his implicit endorsement of Walkers/PepsiCo's
         leverage of Smiths to dominate the UK crisps market, admitted
         he may have been swayed by their "exquisite wordplay"...
         there's strong word-of-mouth on the new "Salt and Vinegar" and
         "Savoury Salted" flavours of QUAKER SNACK-A-JACKS (the
         excellent "Barbecue" now also available in "Jumbo" size)...
         the "New Tortilla" ones ("Nacho Cheese" and "Cool Chilli") are
         the more interesting variants of HULA HOOPS XL (compared to
         the as-you'd-expect "Curry" and "Beef &amp; Mustard")... and you
         can also look forward to "Nice 'N' Spicy" GOLDEN WONDER
         CRISPS; "Smokey BBQ" and "Tangy Salsa" replacing "Cheese and
         Onion" and "Cheese and Ham" KP MINI CHEDDARS; and Dennis-the-
         Menace tie-in "Baked Beano" flavour KP SKIPS - all part of an
         onslaught of new product development that also includes PEANUT
         LION BAR, the unfortunately named FRUITELLA JELLIES, and a new
         look, new recipe and new "Peach and Raspberry" flavour for
         HALLS SOOTHERS, intended to appeal to the 50% of purchasers
         "who don't just use them when they have a sore throat"...
