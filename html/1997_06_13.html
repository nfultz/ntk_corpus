</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV &gt;&gt; So-called psychics submit to so-called scientific
         testing as PREDICTIONS (8.15pm, ITV, Sat) compares their
         prophecies with what really happened over the last 6
         months... Sunday's remarkably dull "machines go mad" double
         bill has Yul Brynner gunslinging through WESTWORLD
         (10.15pm, BBC2) and Julie Christie being attacked by a
         giant Rubik's snake that's attempting to hatch THE DEMON
         SEED (11.45pm, BBC2)... with the start of the fourth
         series, surely it's time someone based a Quake patch round
         the remarkably mobile camerawork of NYPD BLUE (10pm, Mon,
         C4)... Barry Norman fawns over new Batman (oh, you've
         heard) George Clooney in a special FILM 97 (11.05pm, Tue,
         BBC1), before he (George, not Barry) has to go off and save
         the drowning kid in a pipe in a viewers'-favourite repeat
         of ER (10pm, Wed, C4)... real doctors reassure concerned
         locals that a cluster of leukaemia cases are "statistically
         unremarkable" in ANXIETY ATTACK (7.30pm, Wed, BBC2)... and:
         is WAVELENGTH (4.40pm, Wed, ITV) just kids' classic Press
         Gang, only set in a radio station and with not very good
         actors? You decide...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES &gt;&gt; NATIONAL CINEMA DAY (Sun June 15) means it's only
         a quid to get in to most places - which makes it an extra
         shame that there's nothing new out that's much good... look
         out for special previews of upcoming summer hits especially
         Howard Stern's hilarious PRIVATE PARTS) - otherwise, the
         best of a bad bunch is THE SHADOW CONSPIRACY (Charlie
         Sheen, Linda Hamilton, Donald Sutherland), a frankly absurd
         tale of White House corruption and remarkably powerful spy
         satellites... TRIGGER HAPPY (Jeff Goldblum, Diane Lane,
         Kyle MacLachlan,) is a zanily lame gangster parody, but
         surely the presence of Burt Reynolds clued you in to
         that... while, tragically, the funniest thing about
         feminist-impersonation comedy THE ASSOCIATE (Whoopi
         Goldberg, Dianne Wiest) appears to be the poster, whose
         byline ("This is Terrific Entertainment... Smart, Edgy &amp;
         Refreshingly Funny") has its source (WBCS-TV, no less)
         printed in such small writing that you assume it's the
         distributor's description of their *own movie*...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         SCIENCE &gt;&gt; As T. Rex snack on San Diego on the big screen,
         American palaeontologists detect traces of blood on
         dinosaur bones... Swedish geneticists reckon that old
         people depend as much on their genes for their smarts as
         younger ones, so maybe you don't live and learn after
         all... Earth has another moon: an asteroid locked into a
         bizarre horseshoe orbit... meanwhile, out in the cold
         beyond Neptune lurks a strange object 500km across:
         abandoned star destroyer in a parking orbit or big chunk of
         ice? we know which we'd prefer... shock news: "it is not
         likely to be useful or practicable to explain many
         biological processes in terms of particle physics,"
         according to Nature. Damn.                - <a href="mailto:mattb@spesh.com">mattb@spesh.com</a>
