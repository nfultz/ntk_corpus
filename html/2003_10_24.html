</span><span class="item">         There we were, getting our hopes up about the ALL PARTY
         INTERNET GROUP, watching them catch on that spam was a
         serious problem, seeing them beetle off to Washington to
         hobnob with experts on the matter, cheering on the boyish
         enthusiasm of chairman DEREK WYATT MP for the topic. Derek,
         unfortunately, appears to be fighting the good fight with
         the Shield of Wholesale Technical Misunderstanding and the
         U-Shaped Gun Of Shooting One's Own Mouth Off. This week, he
         sent out a press release announcing his own proposed
         solution to spam. Postcodes. No, no, hear him out: Wyatt
         proposes that every UK address have the postcode of the
         recipient prepended between the domain and the .co.uk. So,
         he explains, "derekwyatt@aol.com" would become
         "derekwyatt@aol.swiaoaa.co.uk". Those who don't want to
         give out their postcode could use a six-digit code ("plus a
         pin number which would be held by the Information
         Commissioner's Office"). "Addresses ending .com", he adds,
         as an afterthought, "would need to identify their country of
         origin, such as .com.uk". Yes. Yes, they would, Derek. Mr
         Wyatt is soliciting feedback at <a href="mailto:wyattd@parliament.uk.">wyattd@parliament.uk.</a> Could
         you do it? We're busy banging our heads against this tree.

</span><span class="item">         THE REGEX COACH is a utility for Windows and Linux for
         testing out and walking through Perl-style regular
         expressions. You can interactively try out regexs on test
         data, find out which bits of the expression match what, view
         a graphical version parse tree, and get a confusing
         rendition of what the expression does in convoluted english.
         It's a minor miracle for anyone learning regular
         expressions, and will be a frequent timesaver even for those
         who have slashes on each side of their brain. And, of
         course, it's written in Common Lisp. What *is* it with

         week's plot for tonight's last-in-this-series episode of PEEP 
         SHOW (10.40pm, Fri, C4)... Welsh "Jackass"-alike DIRTY SANCHEZ 
         (11.45pm, Fri, C4) is, one hopes, the rudest TV title of all 
         time... and nothing kicks Saturday night off with more of a 
         bang than 1970s assassination thriller THE DAY OF THE JACKAL 
         (6.45pm, Sat, BBC2)... comedian Jimmy Carr and former "body 
         of Darth Vader" Dave Prowse serve up C4 viewers' THE 100 
         GREATEST SCARY MOMENTS (9.05pm, Sat &amp; Sun, C4) - in a week

         night" (from 9pm, Sun, C5) features both DECODED: THE MAKING 
         OF MATRIX REVOLUTIONS (11.40pm, Sun, C5) and enough clues in 
         ANIMATRIX: SECOND RENAISSANCE (12.10am, Sun, C5) to make the

         Asian lead in one-sided mobile phone drama YOU'RE BREAKING UP 
         (11.20pm, Wed, BBC2)... but it's nuclear annihilation night on 
         digital with a triple-bill of APOCALYPSE NOW - AND THEN (10pm, 
         Wed, BBC4), tedious "protect and survive" counter-propaganda 
         THREADS (10.40pm, Wed, BBC4) and an-all-too literal Hiroshima

         Hot this month: our mock Japanese writing design consisting of 
         semi-random kanji and katakana characters, interspersed with 
         English phrases like "random japanese text" and "computer 
         hobby", plus one of those one of those freaking Internet 
         Explorer alert boxes on top of the whole thing, advising "To 
         display this shirt correctly you need to download: Japanese 
         Text Display Support", and so on. It's available in black, 
         charcoal (dark grey) and steel (turquoise blue), 50p from each 
         sale goes to recent Japlish contest winner DAVID GENTLE (for 
         suggesting the phrases "tap-tap machine" and "Is 'grooved'? 
         Yes grooved!"), while reader RONAN WAIDE has already confirmed 
         that the big writing up at the top does seem to mean something 
         like "to know [something] thing" and/or "shiru (to know) 
         hitsuyousei (necessity)" - hey, as long as it's nothing rude:
