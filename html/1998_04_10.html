</span><span class="item">         In a popular week for near/actual death experiences (Milli
         Vanilli, Tammy Wynette, Kurt Cobain, Jesus), the European
         Net played a few rounds of "chicken" itself. On Tuesday,
         DNS gods NETWORK SOLUTIONS decided that the RIPE.NET domain
         was too dodgy to live, and put it "on hold". Bad idea:
         while an excellent name for a porn site, Ripe is actually
         the major European IP database, storing (amongst other
         items) chunks of Net routing information that many ISPs
         rely on - no RIPE, no Net. Plus, the unsinkable TELEHOUSE
         managed to zap two floors Friday, vanquishing AOL, PsiNet,
         Infocom and other almost-household names. Interestingly,
         this was almost 11 months to the day since the UK Net last
         fritzed, implying that perhaps the Telehouse generators
         really don't "go to eleven". And the scariest part of this
         lesson in the Net's vulnerabilities? Well, did you notice
         anything?

</span><span class="item">         Microsoft launched a US ad campaign to win the public over
         its side of the Force this week. Points made in the
         newspaper placements included identifying that "at the
         heart of this incredible computer revolution is the kind of
         innovation that is uniquely American", and that "Every wave
         of innovation and integration creates another wave of great
         ideas." But some uniquely American ideas are greater than
         others. The LA Times today revealed secret Microsoft
         strategy documents that show Bill's latest wheeze to be a
         fake grass-roots letter-writing campaign, with opinion
         pieces and editorials apparently written by independent
         individuals, but in fact commissioned by Microsoft with
         costs "billed to Microsoft as an out-of-pocket expense". MS
         spokesman Greg Shaw at first denied the plan existed, then
         stated that it was only hypothetical - an innovation indeed
         to the regional PR firms who, the Times says, were lead to
         believe it was a done deal.

</span><span class="item">         ANTINEWS SPECIAL: Guardian Online's Richard Barry ran an
         intriguing story in his Videowatch column this week. In it,
         he claimed that "George Lucas has purchased all Paramount's
         Star Trek rights" and "plans to merge the two films" later
         this year. The two, the piece went on, would be linked by
         an "Ensign Obie" - Dr McCoy's son-in-law, played by Mark
         Hamill. This story originally appeared on April 1st on
         C|Net's GameCenter, where it was written by one April F.
         Ewls. Barry later said that he had checked the story with
         Paramount and "they did not deny it". Barry placed it as
         the fourth most important item in the column, behind a
         Pitfall Harry plug, details of Heretic II - and news of a
         new Tombraider sequel.

</span><span class="item">         Cleaning up their own mess by replacing yet another
         "unhackable" encryption system was reported to have cost
         BSkyB UKP 30million in '96 and *someone* had to pay.
         Unfortunately for pirate card seller Chris Carey, it's him:
         four years in prison for reselling stuff you could have
         found on the Web anyway. Condolences, but it's not all bad
         news for multinational-media-conglomerate-smashing tube-
         jockeys. There's a new version of SELECTOR, the program
         that allows you to repeatedly alter the hard-wired regional
         limitations on DVD-ROMs. UK owners of the Creative Encore
         DVD drive can now watch Zone 1 discs in all their glorious
         phased line alternative. Should you ever be stuck in the US
         with only a PAL TV, that is.

         miniaturised FX-fest FANTASTIC VOYAGE (3.35pm, Sat, BBC2)
         isn't based on an Isaac Asimov story - but nearly could
         have been... Easter weekend means themes, themes, themes,
         with C4's A NIGHT ON THE MERSEY (from 6.30pm, Sat, C4)
         heralding both a massive Brookside overdose and Beatles-
         bootleg BACKBEAT (10pm, Sat, C4), which is like Hackers
         (from the same director), but without all that dumb
         computer stuff... then BBC2's POLITICALLY INCORRECT NIGHT
         (from 9pm, Mon, BBC2) sniggers over a Miss World docu,
         three retro clip-shows, plus an On The Buses film - and

         (8.50am, Mon, ITV), triple billed with the reassuringly

         SHOES (9.50am, Mon, ITV)... go on, try decoding the ASCII
         hex in the rarely-repeated 3D episode of THE SIMPSONS (7pm,

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; virtually nothing new after last week's glut, unless
         you count JUNK MAIL (imdb: thriller/ comedy), a bizarre
         Scandinavian cross between Kevin Costner's The Postman and
         Massimo Troisi's Il Postino - which does, however, feature
         the lyrics from Postman Pat in Norwegian... equally off-
         beat, DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS (imdb: comedy / sex-change) turns
         out to be a rather bland romance merely disguised as an
         intriguing transsexual relationship exploration - and it's
         hardly based on the Joe Jackson song at all... PS: we don't
         think either of these are on particularly wide release yet;
         either that or <a href="http://www.virgin.net/cinema/filmfinder">www.virgin.net/cinema/filmfinder</a> genuinely

         non-teenagers... OFFICIAL UK PLAYSTATION MAGAZINE hasn't
         taken to its new lifestyle-bracket circulation at all well,
         with lame little box-gags, the same tired-looking review
         section, plus a gripping interview with 6 PR people you've
         never heard of (p16). Plus, what's up with their video
         grabbing hardware?... the "Spring 1998" issue of .NET leads
         with a searching account of "Online Identity" that, indeed,
         reads like it's been extensively rewritten (p79), and slams
         CyberSitter for blocking the words "shit" and "fuck"
         possibly sent to one young reader via their hacked netmag
         mailing list (p24)... that said, the first FRONTIERS isn't
         bad at all, despite a bizarre caption mix-up over ICBM,
         Minuteman, and missile (p20), a failure to observe the
         "first issue only 1 pound" rule, and insanely billing
         itself as "the magazine of popular science, technology and
         space" - like space is at all accessible without the first
         two... no, even we don't know why possibly fictional (but
         definitely carnivorous) NTK ed Dave Green is in the current
         issue of BBC VEGETARIAN GOOD FOOD (p20)... The inevitable
