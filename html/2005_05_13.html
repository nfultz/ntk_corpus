</span><span class="item">         The 1400-word terms and conditions for MSN.CO.UK's strong-IP 
         "Thought Thieves" film competition are quite the read, even if 
         you're not the 14-17 year-old they're intended to be read and 
         understood by and complied with in their therein bywhich 
         entirety. Entries must be the "sole work and creation of the 
         person submitting the film" (no sharing your precious 
         intellectual property fluids with your cameraman, Mr Auteur); 
         must not "use third party intellectual property rights" (no 
         furniture, no architecture, only clouds as background); the 
         entry form additionally specifies "Should I be selected as a 
         finalist [...] I will formally licence on terms acceptable to 
         Microsoft, all intellectual property rights in my film and 
         agree to waive all moral rights in relation to my film if 
         requested to do so". But what we made us wonder was: where 
         exactly did Microsoft get this "Thought Thieves" idea from? 
         The idea that people can "steal your thoughts" is surely not 
         original. We're hoping for a class-action by paranoid 
         schizophrenics, who we think came up with the idea that others 
         are stealing the very THOUGHTS FROM YOUR MIND a good few years 
         before Microsoft started losing theirs.

</span><span class="item">         On top of that, legal experts agree, it's not like there's 
         usually copyright in "just an idea" in the first place. It's 
         this (and the fact that it only seems to encourage them) 
         that's preventing us from having more of a pop at sampling 
         pranksters NEGATIVLAND, no doubt currently asking themselves 
         how they can possibly stay cutting-edge and relevant in a 
         world where pretty much any semi-talented PC owner can churn 
         out audio collages to their sort of standard - and beyond. One 
         possibility, on their new album out May 26, has been to base 
         their 10-min "Downloading" track around former Grammy head's 
         Michael Greene's anthemic "insidious virus" address - yes, the 
         same one that NTK readers were enthusiastically remixing 
         shortly after he actually made the speech, certainly not much 
         more than three long years ago.

         running MacOSX, it's an OpenOffice implementation that has
         been stitched, with no care for scruples, to Java *and*
         Cocoa, and probably the corpses of some murdered free
         software coders too. Disorientingly, it works rather well,
         and rather speedily: you don't need X11, it uses Aqua menus

         magic thing that open source practitioners have theorised
         may be "actually printing" (only 300dpi mind you). And it's
