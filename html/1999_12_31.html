        [ Everything is proceeding to plan. Lee and Dave are in the
        mini-sub preparing to take out the Thames Flood Barrier at
        full tide. I am in Mountain View, hurrying around MAE-WEST
        with a fast-depleting knapsack of Semtex hanging jauntily
        from my shoulder. Across the world, Y2K consultants are
        beginning to feel the effects of the powerful time-release
        hallucinogen we secreted onto the pages of "COBOL for
        Dummies" back in 1997. These last few days have left little
        time for love, laughter or editorial conferences, so we hope
        you'll make do with this seasonal quiz based on the last
        years' events. We hope it will take your mind off the the
        sounds of the angry peasant mobs milling outside your
        offices. Answers next week: first correct entry after
        midnight gets two week's supply of Evian and six vials of the
        emergency vaccine. In Year Zero, suckers!

         London cyber-nexus BACKSPACE is, finally, being deleted with an 
         apocalyptic "party to end all parties" down at their old 
         Winchester Wharf address, with hints that some of their operations 
         will be moving to - you've guessed it - The Foundry (ICA servers 
         all "busy" again, we assume?). And, in the most exotic world-end 
         scenario since the SubGenius goof-off, DAVID ICKE is inviting 
         his followers to focus positive mental energy upon the pyramids of 
         Giza, to prevent the creation of a fourth-dimensional portal by a 
         cabal of reptile-hybrid Illuminati, led by Jean Michel Jarre, 
         George Bush, and The Queen.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         NORMAL TV&gt;&gt; ever optimistic, the BBC devotes 28 hours to non-stop 
         coverage of global festivities in 2000 TODAY (from 9.15am, Fri, 
         BBC1), which should produce some interesting variations in tone if 
         there really are any major assassinations, terrorist outrages, 
         nuclear stockpile detonations etc... more promisingly, there's 
         SUPERMAN II (3.05pm, Fri, ITV) plus, still the best VR, video game 
         (and hacking?) movie ever made, ageless CGI classic TRON (5.30pm, 
         Fri, BBC2)... while GRAHAM NORTON (11.15pm, Fri, C4) seems to have 
         complied with our suggestion to stop faking net prank calls, and 
         last week even ran the "Argos dog penis" meme, as featured in NTK 
         1999-12-10... ITV settles for a Woody Allen Millennium (or 
         "Allennium", if you will) with consecutive showings of ANNIE HALL 
         (1.05am, Fri, ITV) and MANHATTAN (10.45pm, Sat, ITV)... Tron 
         villain Dillinger rezzes up again in big-budget remake CINDERELLA 
         (5.55pm, Sat, C4)... and bizarre rescheduling now results in THE 
         ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY (11.40pm, Sat, BBC2) introducing graphic 
         Twin Peaks prequel FIRE WALK WITH ME (11.45pm, Sat, BBC2)... THE 
         TIME MACHINE, the BATTLESTAR GALACTICA pilot and STAR TREK II: THE 
         WRATH OF KHAN comprise an epic sci-fi triple bill (from 3.30pm, 
         Sun, BBC2)... they'll have their work cut out to make the 4-hour 
         adaptation of LONGITUDE (9pm, Sun, C4) any duller than the lame 
         pop-sci book, but they're sure to try... some sort of unofficial 
         shit sci-fi strand (12.30ish, Mon-Fri, C4) includes suspenselss 
         "Village" sequel CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED (Thu) and "Holidays Are 
         Coming" inspiration MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE (Wed).. plus: a different 
         kind of "coke" ad as TV producers at last get the chance to 
         investigate one of their favourite hobby-horses in tremendous 
         detail, via C4's ongoing season on COCAINE (from 9pm, Wed, C4)...

         Faculty, South Park, The Phantom Menace, Go, Deep Blue Sea, The 
         Matrix, Austin Powers 2 - *also* appears on our Top 10 *Worst* 
         Movies Of 1999, despite strong competition from genuine stinkers
         like The Blair Witch Project, Eyes Wide Shut, The Mummy, The
         Sixth Sense, You've Got Mail, Life Is Beautiful, a pirate video of
         Bill Shatner's Free Enterprise, and Dogma. So, to return to the 
         ongoing "Quiz" concept, which of 1999's movie releases matches 
         which category-based content summary?

</span><span class="geekmedia">         PARITY ON, DOOD (the non-compulsory "artistic impression" round)&gt;&gt;
         if you'd rather stay at work (or at home), we're assuming you've got
         a workstation handy. So why not put that free time to waste in the
         the following NTK DIY MUSIC CHALLENGE? Challenge no 1 is the more
         technically demanding of the two: using CoolEdit, or Sonic Foundry
         Acid, or Octamed or something, create an NTK "jingle" - using *only*
         the "Need To Know" phrases from other songs (eg: "Strong" by Robbie 
         Williams, "Never Ever" by All Saints, "If You Want My Love" by
         Jennifer Lopez, "How Deep Is Your Love" by The Bee Gees and, of
         course, "Baby One More Time" by Britney Spears). And stick the MP3 
         on a website somewhere rather than mailing us it, natch. The winner
         (subject to remixing) may well be used as the official "Theme from
         NTK" at any forthcoming public appearances. Challenge no 2 is 
         more immediately rewarding (plus you don't have to search so hard
         for the source material): host your own "crackaoke" party, using the
         ST3 format MIDI player <a href="http://members.aol.com/palleyne1/karfile.html">http://members.aol.com/palleyne1/karfile.html</a>
         (bottom of page) to modify the lyrics of existing MIDI karaoke 
         tracks (eg from <a href="http://midikaraoke.siteshop.net/karaoke/">http://midikaraoke.siteshop.net/karaoke/</a>) into 
         hacker versions <a href="http://www.netspace.org/~dmacks/internet-songbook/">http://www.netspace.org/~dmacks/internet-songbook/</a> 
         (the "Homepage For Nothing" one looks particularly tempting). And, 
         while you're about it, let us know if there's a proper open source
         way of coding them up, though you've gotta love Star3's primitive
         Win3.1 functionality. We've done a few already to get you started:
         <a href="http://www.ntk.net/live/st3s.zip">http://www.ntk.net/live/st3s.zip</a> , featuring a halting version of
         "Write in C" (to the tune of Let It Be), Lamer Vs Kramer original
         "Warez Dood" (to the tune of Hey Jude), and, in tribute to Cliff
         Richard's pioneering combination of Auld Lang Syne and The Lord's 
         Prayer, our own attempt to reproduce the same powerfully
         emotive resonance for the '80s generation. Ladies and gentlemen,
         we leave you with: the lyrics to Adam Ant's "Stand And Deliver" - 
         sung over the "Theme From Friends"...
