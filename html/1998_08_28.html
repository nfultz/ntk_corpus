         the point where we're beginning to smell a rat. Who could
         possibly stand to gain from persuading us to print it? And
         then the BBC start pulling out from the battle to win
         bbc.com from Boston Business Computing. But might there be
         another way they could "own" that domain? And would the
         licence payers mind? And what about this scribbled note
         here, that says that Cliff Stanford was seen sniffing around
         LINX2, wanting to own a chunk of the UK Internet after all?
         You can't even trust 'whois' anymore: we could have *sworn*
         their were a bunch of porn sites with addresses not
         unadjacent to the Progressive Networks offices, but now
         they've all disappeared too. Won't anyone stay still for one

</span><span class="item">         BT has been showing off its net savvy once again, with an
         EASYREACH PAGER press ad showing a page of "amusing" cartoon
         net user stereotypes, each with a vaguely realistic email
         address. Perhaps too realistic, adds privacy activist MARK
         DZ, whose own whois antics reveal that, of the 18 domains,
         12 actually exist, belonging to hopefully understanding
         organisations like Agency.Com, Arabia On Line, and Computing
         Engineers Incorporated (who must be overjoyed to be depicted
         as <a href="mailto:psycho@wwa.com">psycho@wwa.com</a>). Still, perhaps mindful of the US Virgin
         Cola ad that produced 1500 replies to a "made-up" address, 3
         of the other domains are unregistered, 3 more are
         incorrectly formed, and 3 of the real ones give "No MX
         record (no email possible)". What's the message here - BT
         email only has 50 per cent reliability?

         no surprise to discover his past life as an
         ex-keyboardist for Hawkwind and creator of "Shot Down In The

         RICHARD BARRY, the World's Equal Worst Internet Journalist,

         dolites dragging themselves upright in a half-fantasy,
         half-realite, Brixton. That said, he sounds a bit pissed off
         with living like that himself, and as fans will know from
         his Website, he's had a horrible time trying to flog his
         latest book, LOVE AND PEACE WITH MELODY PARADISE. Now it's
         been picked up by a publisher, and he's embarking on a book
         tour with characteristic grumpy cheer. The book is all about
         free festivals, and hippies, and travellers, and, after
         bundles of rejection notes, Millar would be the first to
         concede that it might not be any good. But you could pop by
         one of the readings and see whether he's right. Maybe make
         him a cup of tea either way. The tour starts in London on the 7pm
         2/9/98 at Blackwells, Charing Cross Road, and ends on the
         29/9/98 at Waterstones, Sauchiehall St, Glasgow, with all
         points between.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         It's the time of year for the ICA's acclaimed Radio 1-style
         touring Roadshow: "Hello Skegness! Is everybody ready to
         identify, explore and critique the notions and metaphors of
         cyclic completion?". Well, it may as well be given the
         impenetrable descriptions provided by ISEA '98, the
         INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM FOR ELECTRONIC ARTS, 02-07/09/98.
         There's the "Revolution" Symposium in Liverpool (page reads
         like a Markoff generator fed phrases like "utopian-dystopian
         discourses of cybercultural futurology") and, in Manchester,
         the promising-sounding "Terror" Symposium. Whether you
         attend is a matter for your own conscience; the real debate,
         we feel, is how to pronounce "ISEA" without it sounding like
         "IKEA". Best suggestion so far: "I see", followed by a
         20-second goatee-stroking pause. Then: "I see" again.

         the things in question were a bit useless to start with.
         While the appeal of Bandai's FISH FINDER FOR GAMEBOY
         seems a bit limited at first, we can't wait to see what the
         growing legion of GB hackers will make of this
         ultra-cheap ultra-chirp sonar. Within just a few weeks of the
         Gameboy Camera and Printer release, the coders had already
         reverse engineered the printer protocol (allowing both screen
         dumping to the printer, and backup of the camera images to
         PC). And given that they've pretty much firmed up the C
         development kit, as well as the GB BASIC interpreter, and the
         ingenious "morse code" text editor, it shouldn't take them
         that long to whip up... oh, a self-steering car? Guidance
         system for the blind? Super Mario Doom?

         closing in on the Multimedia Gulch: thwarted attendees of
         the cancelled ROBOT WARS conference wander the streets with
         their spurned, murderous machines. Members of Survival

         <a href="http://www.whorechurch.org/">http://www.whorechurch.org/</a> where, in an insane inversion,

         <a href="http://www.reel.com/">http://www.reel.com/</a>, ignorant of the portents, repeats its
         TV ads for "Titanic", hour after baleful hour.  Down in the
         Valley, the OPEN SOURCE gurus meet.  RICHARD STALLMAN plays
         stern paterfamilias, opining that it's better to quit
         programming forever than take a penny off a proprietary
         company ("become a waiter instead", he suggests)).  Chewing
         thoughtfully on his own hair, he delivers a broadside on the
         diabolism of those who profit by selling unfree manuals for
         free software. TIM O'REILLY, chairman, sponsor, and founder
         of O'Reilly Books, looks on charitably, a Medici inviting
         Savaranola for tea.  JAMIE ZAWINSKI talks of his forthcoming
         sabbatical from Netscape (about time, too, judging from
         <a href="http://www.jwz.org/">http://www.jwz.org/</a>). ERIC S. RAYMOND mentions that he's
         seen a tooled-up LINUS TORVALDS shooting at an undisclosed
         location. "Part of a long-term plan", he smiles, planning
         the Free Software Militia. And the sun chases the mists away
         later every day; and no-one knows whether Burning Man
         (<a href="http://www.burningman.com/">http://www.burningman.com/</a>) will work its unsympathetic
         magic on the share option crops this year; and the city's
         saviours, the geeks, play games of  Quake II, as if
         rehearsing for the end of their world.
