</span><span class="item">         The app that we've always dreamed of - the one that goes
         around the Internet, finds every embarassing mention of you
         ever, and then magically deletes it - may finally be
         available. Attorney General LORD GOLDSMITH, in his role as
         the Peer who goes "Shhhh!", reminded the newspapers that
         they couldn't talk about current court cases without being
         in contempt of court. Then, going all futuristic cyber-Lord
         Justice Dredd on us, he added that if newspapers had any
         articles in their online archives about people in the case,
         published *before the case even existed*, they should delete
         them for the duration of the trial. To repeat that for the
         hard of believing: you can't stop jurors from using Google,
         so the entire media should modify their online history, or
         risk contempt of court proceedings. How will this work
         exactly? A juror googles a defendant's name, clicks on the
         first link and then says "Well, this blog links to a Times
         story with the tag 'dog raper still in the news', but the
         link leads to a 404, SO NOTHING HAPPENED?". I mean, we all
         knew that the blogosphere was beneath contempt: but will
         that now actually be a defence in the eyes of the law?

         both "Advanced" and "Learning" Perl, the latter introduced by

         form)... still, following the recent poster quote advising 
         that "You Must See 'Saw'", at least there haven't been any 
         suggesting that you "Remember To Check Out" Julianne Moore 
         sub-PKD memory-tweaking NSA nonsense THE FORGOTTEN (imdb: 
         abduction; conspiracy; experiment; dutch-angle; shot-in-the-
         back)... or even that you'll "[Heart]" David "Three Kings" O 
         Russell's ostensibly existential ensemble self-indulgence 
         I [HEART] HUCKABEES (imdb: sudanese; absurdism; vulgarity; 
         breast-suckling; topless; self-abuse; dinner-scene)... 

</span><span class="geekmedia">         AVAILABLE IN A WIDE RANGE OF BLACK&gt;&gt; and it's crazy Christmas 
         clearout time over at <a href="http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/">http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/</a> , as what may 
         be the last of the current incarnations of the "404: /Shirt 
         /Tie: Not Found" and "Hey Hey 16K" designs are joined by a 
         loosely law-enforcement themed selection identifying the 
         wearer as either "Network Security" (as proposed by the guys 
         over at PC Extreme magazine), opposed to ID cards (courtesy of 
         the <a href="http://www.no2id.net/">http://www.no2id.net/</a> campaign), or simply "Police Aware" 
         (as originally nominated by reader ALEX TEUGELS just slightly 
         over three years ago - see NTK 2001-09-21)... as that time 
         delay implies, we're kind of doing OK for t-shirt concepts at 
         the moment, with favourites including Scott Keir's lonely 
         flashmob-wear <a href="http://www.scottkeir.com/solitary/solitary.png">http://www.scottkeir.com/solitary/solitary.png</a> - 
         but could whoever sent in the "It's not Asperger's Syndrome" 
         slogan please get in touch? Still, we're always interested in 
         any ideas that are perhaps slightly more original than RICHARD 
         BEER's suggestion: "Any chance you can just copy some of the 
         excellent Thinkgeek ones? I'm not sure if they can copyright a 
         couple of words of text" - unless perhaps he's confusing us 
         with somebody else... which just leaves the celebrity-packed 
         results of this year's "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get 
         One Free" competition, with TV's PHILL JUPITUS and AL 
         Digital's ADAM LAURIE both losing points for locating their 
         illicit product placement in comparatively obscure media 
         outlets (The Yorkshire Evening Post and BBC News 24's "Click 
         Online", respectively <a href="http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/images/">http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/images/</a> ). 
         Congratulations therefore to our old Wired UK nemesis HARI 
         KUNZRU, for sneaking a (mildly) fictionalised version of the 
         old "iloveyou.vbs" design onto page 61 his new novel 
         "Transmission" - Hari wins a free t-shirt of his choice, just 
         as soon as he sends us a pic of the mention that we can put 
         on the site, or the book officially comes out in paperback in 
         2005, whichever happens first...
