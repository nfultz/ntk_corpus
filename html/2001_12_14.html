</span><span class="item">         They said that a bunch of geeks waving placards would do
         nothing to free DMITRY SKYLAROV. And they said that whining
         about obscure Net-torturing provisions in already drafted
         legislation would change nothing. And we believed them, too.
         It's lucky that other people are more foolishly optimistic
         than that. After all, it'd be fair to claim that adverse
         publicity of the Skylarov case contributed heavily to
         everyone's DMCA poster-boy being released yesterday:
         especially Adobe's boycott-prompted wish that Dmitry's
         prosecution be dropped. And while UK government defeats
         during the final stages of legislation are almost unheard
         of, the data retention clause in the Anti-Terrorism Act was
         one of the few to get shot down. Out goes the condition that
         ISP logs can be kept and examined for detecting any crime.
         Now, as heavily lobbied by those "aery-faery" and naive
         civil libertarians, it has to be proper *terrorist* crime.
         Mr Blunkett, in conceding the amendment, commented that the
         logs would have to be kept anyway, to see whether they were
         terrorists or not, and "that is how stupid the Liberal
         Democrats [and their Tory supporters, presumably] are."
         Let's see how stupid the human rights judges, and the Data
         Protection folk are when they get to work on this.
         Meanwhile, here's to another year of stupid protestors and
         their clearly impossible victories.

</span><span class="item">         Top "thinking outside the box" marks to the BRIGHTON NEW MEDIA
         mailing list, who may just have solved the problems of
         irrelevance and poor attendance that have bedevilled so many
         of this year's new media awards. As well as devising rather
         more honest categories ("The Sinclair C5 Award for Design,
         Style and Usability", "The Ian Paisley Award for Online
         Statesmanship &amp; Community Bonding" etc), the folks behind the
         NERDY ceremony, attended by a crowd of 40 in Brighton this
         Wednesday, were able to ensure that many of the recipients
         would be present to receive their gongs - via the ingenious
         tactic of giving most of them to each other and their friends.
         Nonetheless, co-organiser (and four-time nominee) JO CHIPCHASE
         earnestly emphasised the scrupulously democratic nature of the
         voting system ("IP addresses could be tracked, if necessary"),
         and the fact that two-time winner Mike Halsey had merely
         "organised the party" where the awards were being held - so
         nothing sinister going on there. C'mon guys - if you want to
         be taken seriously as a new media accolade, you need to work
         out an impenetrable judging system where *all* the awards go
         to cronies of yours that nobody else has ever heard of.

</span><span class="item">         GOOGLE's list of USENET firsts - published to celebrate the
         new 20-year archive is ... riveting. Not because someone
         bleating about waiting "to see all nine parts of Star Wars"
         was the first mention of Phantom Menace (1982). No - it's
         because it's Randall "Perl Fugitive from Justice" Schwartz
         doing the bleating. USENET was the hatching ground for many
         of computing's leaders, and looking back over two decades,
         we see a remarkable consistency in their youth. Perl
         missionary Larry Wall initially appears in the archive
         exploring the nature of salvation - in Return of the Jedi
         ("there is an afterlife, however holographic it may be").
         Idealist Jamie Zawinski characteristically introduces
         himself while fuming about various historical injustices -
         notably, the replacement of Wookies with Ewoks. And if it's
         not Star Wars that inspired our young leaders, it's the next
         best thing. One of John Gilmore's first posts is a quibble
         about the accuracy of the phrase "fish taco" in certain
         unspecified contexts. And surely no-one would think of
         posting to alt.support.herpes under their *own names*? Think
         we're giving links? Come on - it's the triumphant return of
         the USENET scavenger hunt!

         we don't have a Gameboy Advance *or* a GBA Flash Cartridge
         programmer. In all honesty then, we can't say we've
         exhausively tested FOON, Strags' new ZX Spectrum Emulator
         for the GBA. Tesla-like, though, we have emulated it
         perfectly in our heads - and what's not to admire? We liked
         that the Gameboy series has reached a sophistication that
         allows it to be a emulatix as well as an emulatand. We like
         the Speccie. We like that the author has been frantically
         cranking out updates to Foon for weeks on his site. We even
         like that he asked "Is it considered bad form to try and
         plug your own stuff in NTK?" too. It is bad form, Strags:
         but we *reward* bad form.

         the unthrillingly live and dangerous BRITISH COMEDY AWARDS
         (9pm, Sat, ITV) segue neatly into nuclear exploding helicopter
         hilarity BROKEN ARROW (10.15pm, Sat, BBC1)... and Malcolm
         "Clockwork Orange" McDowell explores what Hogwarts would be
         like if the kids had automatic weapons instead of spells in IF
         (12.30am, Sat, BBC2) - more entertaining than Cronenberg low-
         budgeter THE BROOD (12.50am, Sat, C4) and the similarly themed
         puberty-confronting body-horror MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS:
         THE MOVIE (5.10pm, Sun, C5)... "ordinary Americans" boldly
         deny allegations of their country's "global arrogance" in
         CORRESPONDENT (7.15pm, Sun, BBC2)... Jennifer Lopez's breasts
         - and Sean Penn's ass - are "briefly visible" towards the end
         of Oliver Stone's knockabout smalltown comedy U-TURN (10pm,
         Sun, C4)... and both THE SOUTH BANK SHOW (Sun, 11pm, Sun) and
         OMNIBUS (6.45pm, Sat, BBC2) attempt a ratings-boost by
         ditching their usual arts coverage in favour of "The Making
         Of: The Lord Of The Rings"... as WW2 rages on in THE BATTLE OF
         HOOD AND BISMARCK (9pm, Mon &amp; Tue, C4), Pamela Anderson takes
         a look at the lighter side of the conflict in nipple-packed
         "Casablanca" remake BARB WIRE (10.35, Mon, C4)... a funnier
         ending to otherwise excellent biometric-security-critique
         GATTACA (10.35pm, Tue, C5) would have Ethan Hawke boarding a
         spaceship secretly carrying gallons of other people's wee...
         leaving you with a choice of a STEPTACULAR CHRISTMAS (7pm,
         Thu, C5), NIGELLA BITES CHRISTMAS (8pm, Thu, C4), VETS IN
         PRACTICE AT CHRISTMAS (8pm, Thu, BBC1), HAVE YOURSELF A VERY

         release dates seem to have restricted the VCD previews of THE

         otherwise there's Tilda Swinton - from Orbital's "The Box"
         video - in the "Suture" guys' arthouse suspense-noir remake
         THE DEEP END (<a href="http://www.cndb.com/">http://www.cndb.com/</a> : [Swinton's] dark nipples
         are definitely visible through her wet undershirt, but we
         never get a decent view)... it's Ali "Varsity Blues" Larter,
         Ronny "Total Recall" Cox and Colin "Ballykissangel" Farrell -
         together at last! - in explosive neo-Western AMERICAN OUTLAWS
         (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/americanoutlaws.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/americanoutlaws.htm</a> :
         gunfire deaths, many, some graphic - not considered murder
         since they were due to warfare or other military/police
         action; open mouth kissing; flippant talk of killing)... or a
         limited-re-release for the start of David Lynch's slide into
         wilful suburban weirdness, BLUE VELVET (<a href="http://www.cndb.com/">http://www.cndb.com/</a> :
         we briefly see [Isabella Rossellini's] ass, a breast, and even
         her bush. Then, near the end of the film, we get a distant
         full frontal shot of her, and a close look at her breasts.
         Then we see a bit more when she goes into a car, and once
         she's inside a house; [Rosselini] holds [Kyle "Dune Guy"
         MacLachlan] at knifepoint and forces him to strip. We see his
         beautiful ass and a get a good frontal shot. For embarrassment
         fetishists, this is a 4-star must-see)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         THE "VICTORIAN AFFECTATION"&gt;&gt; What's that? You live outside
         the UK and are therefore too late to order a fashionable
         "They Stole Our Revolution" FBI-style NTK jacket (US$30) from
         <a href="http://www.ntkmart.com/">http://www.ntkmart.com/</a> ? But you've accidentally run your
         thumb over a few PRINGLES tubes in the supermarket and wrote
         down the Amazon UKP2 gift voucher codes, pretending you were
         making frantic last-minute modifications to your shopping
         list? Well, your first stop should of course be our official
         bestsellers list at <a href="http://www.ntk.net/books/">http://www.ntk.net/books/</a> , which shows
         that, this month, NTK readers have been mostly reading drug-
         crazed Tolkien-parody BORED OF THE RINGS (a high new entry,
         with 6 sales so far), while the lower reaches of the chart
         reflect the seasonal mood turning towards love poetry, erotic
         anime, programmable logic controllers, the novels of Brian
         "AI" Aldiss, and the wit of Jerry Seinfeld - enough, we hope,
         for some lucky recipient to construct their own humanoid sex
         robot, then make jokes about it afterwards... not on the list
         yet is Charlie Brooker's slimline scatology TV GO HOME (UKP7.99)
        <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841156752/needtoknow0e">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/1841156752/needtoknow0e</a>
         - not drawing on the online archive as much as we'd expected,
         possibly with a view to a followup publication next year? For
         the boffin in the family, Steven Johnson's EMERGENCE: THE
         CONNECTED LIVES OF ANTS, BRAINS, CITIES AND SOFTWARE (UKP11.99)
        <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0713994002/needtoknow0e">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0713994002/needtoknow0e</a>
         is already being described round here as "Kevin Kelley's 'Out
         Of Control' - but for people who read books", while resident
         NTK fanboy BEN MOOR was characteristically uncritical of Frank
         Miller's DC-continuity-flaunting Batman vs Superman sequel
         DK2: THE DARK STRIKES AGAIN (only in comic stores, around
         UKP5.95 - <a href="http://www.dccomics.com/features/dk2/dk2.html">http://www.dccomics.com/features/dk2/dk2.html</a> ).
         And rounding off this Editors' Selection of tomes you could
         probably print most of off the net if you could really be
         bothered to, kudos to reader MARTIN DODGE for mentioning NTK
         on page 158 of his co-authored ATLAS OF CYBERSPACE (UKP30):
        <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201745755/needtoknow0e">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201745755/needtoknow0e</a>
         which combines an academic introduction to critical map-
         reading with gorgeous coffee-table-style abstractions of the
         Mbone, newsgroups and MOOs. "Could it be 'The Visual Display
         of Quantitative Information' for the 21st century?" we
         wondered (but were unable to answer, as we haven't read Ed
         Tufte's original yet)... other than that, you're stuck with
         Amazon's own slightly bizarre suggestions - for mums with a
         sense of humour, Anne Robinson's MEMOIRS OF AN UNFIT MOTHER:

         let's face it, Granny's hardly going to notice that you got
         her two copies of WEST SIDE STORY on video - nos 8 and 16 at

         yes, it's hard to resist great opportunities to "Save 20%" on
         the award-winning JIMMY CORRIGAN: THE SMARTEST KID ON EARTH:
