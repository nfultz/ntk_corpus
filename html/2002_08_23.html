</span><span class="item">         Well, it's getting late, and the government hasn't fallen,
         so we better roll the presses on the bad news. The CAMPAIGN
         FOR DIGITAL RIGHTS published its first in-depth analysis of
         the EUCD. For this exciting installment, CD-R has
         concentrated on what it does to people who have to
         circumvent copy protection to do their job. The short
         summary is: if they're not a teacher, a prison warder,
         disabled, or the cops, they can forget their jobs. If you're
         anyone else - like a musician, or a cryptographer -  and the
         copy protection says you can't make a backup, you can't. And
         even if you *are* a teacher or other exceptional person,
         you'll have to ask the Secretary of State if you can crack
         the protected CD. In writing. Each time.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         But there's plenty more to ooze out of the law than that.
         One of the big questions about the EUCD is "is it the
         European DMCA, or what?". Well, the DMCA spurted bad juice
         in many different directions, but one way in which the two
         are similiar is over "circumvention devices". Distributing
         DeCSS, the DVD lobby have claimed, is a crime under the
         DMCA. DeCSS is code that was also a magically dangerous
         artifact: a circumvention device. Circumvention devices are
         about to become illegal here. Specifically, three months in
         chokey (or two years if you really nark the judge), for
         those who "distribute otherwise than in the course of a
         business to such an extent as to affect prejudicially the
         copyright owner" one of them. "Otherwise in the course of
         business" is legalese for "as an ordinary punter", so it's
         not just mod-chip sellers who are liable. Anyone who
         distributes such satanic machines is also a perp.

</span><span class="item">         That's not going to go down well with ANDREW SIMMONS.
         Regular NTK readers will remember Andrew as a lightning rod
         to lawyers. Not only was he John Doe #13 in the American
         DeCSS case, but in a completely unrelated affair, he waws
         threatened with all manner of nastiness just for publishing
         his list of doomed dotcoms on his Website [NTK 2000-09-22].
         In the last week, he's had another letter via Demon, finally
         ordering him to remove his shiny "circumvention device" (aka
         DeCSS) from his site. It sounds like the lawyers may have
         shot their wad a tad early: the EUCD rules don't kick in
         until Christmas. But when the new laws do hit, and if what
         Andrew's preposterous correspondent says is believed in a UK
         court, hosting DeCSS *will* mean jail. There's been some
         talk about how the EUCD rules are better than the DMCA,
         because they specifically exclude computer programs from the
         new rules. Well, it looks like DeCSS is no longer just a
         computer program. From now on, it could become a special "nick me"
         tag for your Website.

         BAYES THEOREM has a reputation for making judges look stupid
         in DNA-testing murder cases, and search-engines look even
         stupider when they suggest "relevant documents" - but it's
         getting a bit of a re-renaissance in the spam filtering
         world. Tradition states Naive Bayesian alone doesn't work
         well enough at filtering by example, so it's good to see
         dozens of people independently sloshing around the noospere
         looking for better tweaked solutions. Including, of course,
         leading noosphere cadet ERIC S RAYMOND, whose Bayesian
         BOGOFILTER is fast, has extra smarts, and is up to version
         0.2. Unfortunately, as with Raymond's abandoned kernel
         configurator and recent anti-gay anti-islam anti-vegetable
         rants, it requires taking on board just a *bit* too
         much extra baggage to really take off. Rennies' IFILE around
         has been around for a while, and has support for MH and
         mutt. Gary Arnold's BAYESPAM is something he knocked up in
         Perl for qmail; a good start if you want to try this
         yourself. Which you should, because nobody's cracked it yet.

         Yul Brunner 1970s post-apocalyptic beat-em-up THE ULTIMATE
         WARRIOR (12.40am, Fri, C5), John "The Last Seduction" Dahl's
         bonkers brainscanner UNFORGETTABLE (2.05am, Fri, C4), and the
         seems-to-last-an-eternity STARGATE (11.05pm, Sat, BBC1)... the
         BBC have swiftly replaced the advertised showing of serial
         killer psycho-profiler "Messiah 2" with repeats of THE LOST
         WORLD (9.15pm, Sat, BBC1)... and, considering what came after,
         AMERICAN PIE (9.05pm, Sat, C4) may be eventually regarded as
         one of the great teen movies of all time... it's a double-
         Arnie fertility-horror double-bill in TWINS (6.20pm, Sun,
         BBC1) and JUNIOR (4.50pm, Mon, BBC1)... Nell McAndrew and
         Rhona Cameron contribute to a slightly vague interpretation of
         "celebrity" in I'M A CELEBRITY - GET ME OUT OF HERE! (8pm,
         Sun, ITV)... WHEN [DIANA] DIED - DEATH OF A PRINCESS (9pm,
         Sun, C4) contains "scenes of nudity and religious ritual" -
         funny what people find offensive nowadays ... and Jeff "Tron"
         Bridges plays the other half of that K-Pax double-act in
         STARMAN (2.30pm, Mon, C5) - all together now: "You don't
         understand, Mrs Hayden: that *thing* is no longer your
         husband!"... archaeology imitates "Coneheads" in ANCIENT
         MURDER MYSTERY: RIDDLE OF THE CONE-SHAPED SKULLS (8pm, Mon,
         C5)... odd scheduling for Bill Murray's kid-friendly identity
         mixup THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO LITTLE (11.05pm, Tue, BBC1)... and
         if only they'd got hold of Tim Burton's recent "reimagining"
         to show after the run of BATTLE FOR/ FAREWELL TO/ BACK TO
         THE PLANET OF THE APES (1.30pm, Tue-Thu, ITV), you could have

         "Bad Boys" Lawrence and Academy Award nominee Tom "In The
         Bedroom" Wilkinson - together at last! - in funnier-than-

         King fart at dinner; some kids might want to imitate all of
         the action-based fighting that occurs)... or there's badfilm
         stalwart Heather Graham and "My Cousin Vinny" Academy Award
         winner Marisa "In The Bedroom" Tomei in clumsy Bollywood porn
         comedy pastiche THE GURU ( <a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/">http://www.bbfc.co.uk/</a> : Contains

         and now features lengthy explanations of exactly what PayPal
         will attempt to charge you. Also new this month: lots of
         designs now available in XXL, including the ever-popular 404
         /SHIRT/TIE NOT FOUND, a glow-in-the-dark variant of the ZX
         font BORN TO RUN one, plus slightly more limited numbers of
         the arcade-style HI-SCORE TABLE and the last few remaining
         souvenirs from June's EXTREME COMPUTING show. Oh and copies of
         Mark Bennett's BLACK ICE magazine (for just US$7 plus postage
         and packing) - Brighton's very own answer to "Mondo 2000"...
         meanwhile, your entries have continued to flood in, a leading

         design skills aren't up to this high standard, you can of
         course just mail us a text slogan, so long as it's at least as
         funny as SIMON LIPSON's "NTK: ROTFL meets ROT-13", ANDREW
         SIMMONS' "NTK: Notes you don't want to save, and for link
         evaluation", or PHIL SOUTH's "Frieze - Marther - Farquhar" -
         but designed to look like it's the name of a law company!...
         meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/">http://www.geekstyle.co.uk/images/</a> gallery
         reveals the "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, Get One Free"
         contest to be hotting up once again, as 25-year-old web
         designer GRAEME DAVISON "just happened" to be wearing the
         shirt that spells "fuck" in ASCII URL-encoding when he was
         photographed by THE NORTHERN ECHO about his trip to see
         "Attack Of The Clones" open in LA. Even though this was only a
         local newspaper, the judging panel felt he deserved the full
         prize (of another t-shirt), as the story goes on to cover the
         ostensibly pointless nature of the entire exercise. That's the
         kind of product placement that money just can't buy...
