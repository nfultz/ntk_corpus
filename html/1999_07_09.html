</span><span class="item">         OFTEL, quasi-governmental scapegoat/poodle/monkey mutant
         creature hated by all, last weak went feral, leaping up and
         biting the nose of its BT nanny/dogcatcher/organgrinder. In
         a shocking, shocking move, it announced its intention to
         force BT to open up the local loop and allow others to share
         the implementation of xDSL and other copper services. That's
         awkward for BT, who had recently leaked their decision to
         roll out ADSL superquick - almost certainly in part to stop
         Oftel feeling it needed a shove. But will BT shove back, and
         deliberately retard development? Well, no. It keeps saying
         it might, but it won't. BT has much easier ways of slowing
         entry in this area: including, for example, having really
         grotty stuff in its exchanges that no-one else would want to
         touch with a 14.4 modem. There's forty years of gunk in
         there, man. And BT's still hoping that the other Telcos
         will get as excited about broadband wireless comms as the
         DTI is now getting, now that's decided to auction off some
         of the spectrum. Good for BT: because it keeps them off
         their turf. And good for BT, because the DTI's report is so
         caught up in big telco, big investment broadband ideas, that
         it pays no attention the bottom-up spread spectrum networks
         that might really pose a threat to the comfortable telco
         oligopoly. Oh, but that lead to chaos, wouldn't it?

</span><span class="item">         A few brief updates on some recent and ancient stories. For
         those wondering what's happening with the E-COMMERCE BILL:
         the government are *really* keen to rush it through
         parliament, and waved it under the oppositions' noses to
         get it carried over to the Autumn. The Tories, to give them some
         credit, have muttered "not so fast", and are now debating
         internally as to whether to bounce the whole thing out of
         the parliamentary schedule altogether. Go, conservative scum!

</span><span class="item">         KEVIN MITNICK is still in jail, and just had his appeal
         against the $1,000,000 bail set for his California trial
         turned down. Kevin is charged with making a fraudulent phone
         call. In what we can only assume is either a *very* cool
         social engineering hack or some very targetted advertising
         (or *both*), Cable &amp; Wireless' new ad campaign is based on
         the slogan "Free Kevin". It's even in the right colour scheme.

         Net, not the actual content. Boy, those kids have been
         getting *really* high off that New Labour policy erasing
         fluid, haven't they? And in other awards, it was Yell last

</span><span class="item">         Awards too, to STUART CAMPBELL AND CO: for being undoubtedly
         the hardest bastards in known games journalism. First
         generation NTKers will recall [NTK 1998-01-23] that the
         gang's Web tribute to the beautiful and dead Future mag
         AMIGA POWER was casually copied onto the cover CD of ancient
         EMAP enemies CU AMIGA. At the time, the editors chuckled at
         Stuart's claims that the AP team would sue them for two
         years' wages. One court settlement in Campbell's favour and
         five figures later, the chuckling, for EMAP, is at an end.
         And this story - like all Amiga stories - looks set to drag
         endlessly on: "It is thought", says Campbell in his own
         profoundo press-release voice, "that part of these proceeds
         will be used to fund the prosecution of several court cases
         against another major leisure-computing magazine publisher
         in the next few weeks."

</span><span class="item">         In celebration of Microsoft's recent GLOAT ABOUT BLOAT in
         Sloat, er, SLATE this week's tracking is a
         fat-downloads-interesting-ideas-how-do-I-uninstall special.
         [ <a href="http://www.slate.com/webhead/99-07-06/webhead.asp">http://www.slate.com/webhead/99-07-06/webhead.asp</a> ]

</span><span class="item">         In the big country on planet Linux, we offer you XSHIPWARS,
         which has been around for a couple of months, and is already
         huge. You'd describe it as a bloated xtrek - a server-based
         2D real-time space sim with chunky graphics and bleeps and
         planets and a smooth widget set and explosions. Except that,
         historically, it's actually a bloated FurryMUCK game system.
         Yup, this software has grown to 32 meg of multimedia - *from
         a text-based game*. And it's still early days. Potentially
         addictive, but we need the disk space back so we could
         actually breathe in here, so no long term tests. Eat it!

</span><span class="item">         For Windows users? Well, what could be better than an even
         fatter (yet incompatible!) version of ICQ? ODIGO is a buddy
         system that includes *very* snazzy graphics, a intuitive
         radar system for spotting fellow travellers who are visiting
         the same Website as you, an intriguing "find the most
         popular sites currently" button, and a ridiculously detailed
         set of personal interests you can nominate (our favourite:
         media/tv/closed-caption systems). Also lots of buttons that
         go bleep, and an installation program that sings opera.
         Interesting concepts, some heavy privacy issues, already
         category-killed by ICQ, worth the download, not worth the
         diskspace, know what we're saying?

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; a bizarre replay of third week of April 1998 [see NTK
         1998-04-17], with another showing of urban deliverance
         soundtrack tie-in JUDGMENT NIGHT (11.15pm, Fri, BBC1), a
         repeat of the one where Lilith comes back in FRASIER (10pm,
         Fri, C4), plus even Lee &amp; Herring reporting from Montreal's
         FESTIVAL OF FUN (11.55pm, Sun, C5)... various moon-landing
         tie-ins line up for re-entry, including MOONSHOT - THE
         SPIRIT OF '69 (10.10pm, Sat, ITV), 4Later's double-bill of
         cheap Nasa footage over techno tunes THE TRIP (12.45am, Sat,
         C4) and, capturing that old military-industrial spirit
         rather better than the rest, the satellite debut of STARSHIP
         TROOPERS (10pm, Sat, Sky Premier)... plus, two weeks ago,
         they run a "Twister" season, and homes across Britain were
         hit by mini-hurricanes (where's that Onion "Twisters Blamed
         On Media Portrayal Of Extreme Weather" link when we need
         it?). So, basically, god knows what'll happen when BBC1 rip
         off more of Discovery's schedule in what seems to be a SHARK
         WEEK (from 6.10pm, Sun, BBC1)... Jimmy McGovern's
         hard-hitting scouse strike drama DOCKERS (10pm, Sun, C4)
         does not appear to be based around the trousers ad of the
         same name... and everyone's singin' like canaries over new
         mob comedy THE SOPRANOS (10pm, Thu, C4) - though the quirky
         everyday problems of mafia hoods do seem to be a major
         current trend, seen also in recent US movie release "Analyze
         This" and, intriguingly, likely precursor NATIONAL LAMPOON'S
         THE DON'S ANALYST (12.40am, Fri, Sky Moviemax)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; early Thursday previews of STAR WARS EPISODE 1: THE
         PHANTOM MENACE (imdb: star-wars / blockbuster / boy /
         council / android / cult-favorites / desert / droid /
         famous-score / war / futuristic / aliens / spacecraft /
         part-computer-animation / space / queen / racing / robot /
         prequel / space-opera / space-travel / swordfight /
         underwater / apprentice / epic / betting / saga) so guess we
         ought to review it: predictably effects-heavy, yet
         unpredictably odd, genuinely like old black and white Flash
         Gordon serials ("let's aimlessly fly around from one planet
         to another, then go and visit the fish men") but with better
         CGI. Only absence of Mark Hamill detracts from the authentic
         flavour of a Lucasarts CD-ROM adventure; as reader MATT
         BACON once said of Iain M Banks: "I've had some good games
         of Traveller in my time, but I don't go to the trouble of
         writing them all down"... not much else out except latest
         sassy teen Shakespeare gynacologist comedy 10 THINGS I HATE
         ABOUT YOU (imdb: school / teen), with the kid out of "Third
         Rock From The Sun"... so time for a just-for-fun quick
         competition: which recently released US hit is *this* a
         breathlessly enthusiastic review of... [SPOILERS AHEAD!]

         "God was called many vulgar and hateful names. Satan was
         glorified. Jesus was equated with sexual anatomy. A child
         was graphically incinerated by igniting his anal wind, then
         another kid tried to beat out the flames with a stick and
         was concerned about the stick catching fire. Body parts
         dripping with blood were ripped from a child by a surgeon
         who expressed shallow concern. The dead child was then seen
         with an exploded chest. The dead child, after being rejected
         from Heaven (by nude female angels) and cast into Hell, was
         then presented as a ghost trying to influence the other
         kids. An all-male chorus line wore pink bikini briefs.
         Homosexual acts were described. Decomposing burned bodies
         were cast as live occupants of Hell. "Big brother"
         electronic shock control of a child was used to prevent his
         use of foul language (each time he cussed he was shocked -
         he used this shock later to defeat Hussein by shouting every
         known and several unknown foul words). A man committed
         suicide by jumping out of a window. And throughout the movie
         was script to promote licentious belittlement of wholesome
         life and entertainment: rationale to lessen even further the
         threshold of acceptance."

         - and, no, it's not the beginning of the first Naked Gun
         film. Remember, it's just for fun, so don't write in; check

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FEAR OF A BLACK HAT&gt;&gt; [with NTK's roving reporter, the UK's
         least famous David Phelan]: first keynote was JEFFREY HUNKER,
         of the Critical Infrastructure Assurance Office, explaining
         the US gov's 10 step plan (PDD 62) to defend against groups
         with "organised capabilities", but "not cyberwarfare in the
         science-fiction sense" - what, like The Matrix? The plan is
         known by the credibity-enhancing nickname of "version 1.0",
         and was presented on OHP slides - one way to keep your data
         secure... in keynote #2, DR MUDGE <a href="http://www.l0pht.com">http://www.l0pht.com</a>
         launched a new promiscuous mode device detector, AntiSniff 
         - until two uniformed security guards turned up (to make a
         public announcement). All he said on seeing them approach the
         podium was "Uh oh"... SIMPLE NOMAD <a href="http://www.nmrc.com">http://www.nmrc.com</a>
         announced Netware [c|h]acking tool Pandora v4, but not before
         revealing that a vulnerability had been found in Hunkers
         version 1.0, and advised everyone to upgrade to 1.0a,
         otherwise their country might be taken over... and Bill
         Cheswick talked about internet mapping, which he does via a
         daily customised traceroute of 90,000 nets from a dual
         Pentium 90 running BSDi - "it said install Windows 95 or
         better". The military find this fascinating: "It's okay for
         me to ping Finland, but if the Air Force does it - that might
         be an act of war". The Australian government was first to
         complain about the probes; in March he started a scan of
         Yugoslavia (to see the servers going down all over Bosnia)
         but his slides were dramatically punctuated by fire sirens
         and strobe lighting, due to Vegas' heavy rainfall [see Event
         Queue]. Bill closed with holiday snaps of the Great Wall of
         China, Edinburgh Castle, and cells from the inside of his
         cheek - not, one hopes, tourist attractions of equivalent
         popularity...
