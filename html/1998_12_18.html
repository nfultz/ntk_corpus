         cyber-liberties, cyber-unreadable-homepage" Akdeniz's
         letter-writing campaign begins to get results. Yamiz asked
         ISPs what their policy was on the police inspection of
         e-mail. Did it require a warrant? Or (as anecdotal evidence
         to NTK implies) are the police able to gain access without
         legal restraint? For such a clean-cut question, ISP
         reactions have been most peculiar. The ISP's head Nicholas
         Lansman went quite schtum, refusing to answer the query, and
         - according to Network Week - advising his members to
         "ignore the letter". Hello, hello, hello - if you're so
         innocent, sunshine, what have you got to hide? Or do we have
         to get a warrant to find out what ISP privacy policies are?
         Meanwhile, the chairman of ISPA, in a curious show of bias
         towards pay-your-way ISPs, told the Register "you should ask
         yourself - are free Internet services (like Freespace)
         *really* free?". Well, yes, Nicholas, they are, unless
         you're a competing service provider, of course. Now could
         you answer our question?

</span><span class="item">         You'd think STEVE MANN would be the last person to demand
         privacy for his fellow men. Was he not Mr Headcam, stalking
         the corridors of MIT with a noggin-mounted Webcam,
         encouraging thousands to log on for a chance of catching
         Negroponte in the urinal? Now Steve says that he's seen the
         future - and the coverage is *far too good*. To fight back
         against unnecessary surveillance, he's launched SHOOTUP DAY
         - 24 hours when everyone marches into shops and workplaces
         that use CCTVs, and monitor them back. Mann suggests
         recording on camera any law-breaking by the corporations
         (padlocked fire exits, work and safety breaches, criminal
         assault by humourless security personnel, etc). The first
         day of action is set for 24/12/98, so you'll have plenty of
         great crowd shots in the stores. Meanwhile, armchair privacy
         advocates can tune instead to TONY BENN's ITV documentary on
         the 27th, where he'll be filming NEW LABOUR'S
         backbencher-surveillance systems (geek content: pagers,
         faxes, Darkside Millbank wonks). Or perhaps you could use up
         your remaining Xmas film by taking nude photos of Boots
         developing staff? Up to you.

</span><span class="item">         Thanks to everyone who chipped in to the STAND campaign over
         the last week. Given that it's an obscure technical issue
         that nobody understands, over two thousand volunteers
         adopting five hundred MPs in just one week isn't too shabby.
         Also, you may be interested to know that a week ago, the
         only way to get hold of the imminent crypto consultation
         document was to telephone Anne, a very nice lady at the DTI,
         and ask to be put on a list. No e-mail, we said? Oh, no.
         This is easier, they said. On Wednesday, Anne contacted us.
         I'm being telephoned by people from all over the world every
         two minutes, and I can't get any work done- Would you mind
         if I gave you an e-mail address to contact instead? You
         know, I think with a bit of training, they might just get it...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; the hour-long special of FRIENDS (9.30pm, Fri, C4)
         features extra pilot footage, out-takes, and a "previously
         unheard song from Phoebe", as if you needed any further
         encouragement (not to watch it)... could those be CGI dice
         rolling the soporific fate of Woody Harrelson, Demi Moore in
         response to Robert Redford's INDECENT PROPOSAL (9.30pm, Fri,
         BBC1)?... don't watch space-set Gremlins rip-off CRITTERS 4
         (11.50pm, Fri, BBC1) with your Furby... and the same goes
         for Doris Wishman's famously dodgy single-handed '60s
         exploito-flick NUDE ON THE MOON (1.45pm, Fri, C4)...
         disappointingly, Isabel Allende's HOUSE OF THE SPIRITS
         (10.30pm, Sat, BBC2) is not, repeat *not*, a magical realist
         version of Ghostbusters... and TV creates more Titanic
         mysteries than it solves, like why is that submarine show
         called TITANIC LIVE (8pm, Sat, C4) when it actually happened
         in August, and it wasn't even live then?... is the title of
         TITANIC: BREAKING NEW GROUND, on the same night (11.45pm,
         Sat, ITV), supposed to be ironic, or what?... and, now that
         Ad &amp; Joe have already had a pop, which out of the ones done
         by Harry Enfield or French And Saunders will be the *worst
         Titanic spoof of all time*, making slow death by
         hypothermia/ drowning seem positively delightful by
         comparison?... somehow, neither disturbing child-abuse
         classic WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (5.45pm, Sun,
         BBC2) nor lame Robin Williams remake TOYS (8pm, Sun, C4) are
         as cynical as Bill Murray's sarcastic feelgooder SCROOGED
         (11.35pm, Sun, BBC1)... Greg Proops (arguably the least
         worst thing about that Space Cadets quiz show), Servalan,
         and 3 Dr Who "companions" join CLIVE JAMES ON TV (10pm, Mon,
         ITV) to make cheap gags about cheap sci-fi... Sandra Bullock
         watches her future career slip downhill at quite an
         impressive SPEED (9.30pm, Tue, BBC1)... and THIS BLOKE WALKS
         INTO A BAR (11.05pm, Tue, C4) sees Bob Mortimer and Rowland
         Rivron explain how alcohol helps their performances - by
         getting audiences drunk enough to laugh at them... a porn
         star, a fundamentalist, a UFO nut - surely there's a casting
         agency specialising in recycling guests for LOUIS THEROUX'S
         WEIRD CHRISTMAS (10.15pm, Wed, BBC2)... and C5 reaches the
         logical conclusion of its liking for low budgets and
         pseudo-serious smut, with a Christmas Russ Meyer season
         starting with FASTER PUSSYCAT! KILL! KILL! (12.30am,
         Christmas Eve, C5)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; after the anti-climactic mid-week Mask Of Zorro
         showings, no further info about which films to walk out of
         after the STAR WARS TRAILER - and no longer bearing the
         "Phantom Menace" subtitle, we note... groovy Antz-style cast
         and many unnecessary songs pad out animated Ten Commandments
         remake PRINCE OF EGYPT (imdb: biblical / kids-and-family)
         (what about "based-on-novel"? - Ed.). MPAA rated it PG "for
         intense depiction of thematic elements", which means the
         very young may not appreciate the regular slaughterings of
         the first-born... slightly more potential in widespread
         weekend previews of ENEMY OF THE STATE (imdb: conspiracy /
         political / surveillance / chase / fugitive), but not even
         Will Smith, Gene Hackman or Jerry Bruckheimer can completely
         get away with this by-the-numbers NSA actioner. And that
         tagline "It's Not Paranoia if They're Really After You" -
         surely "out to get you" is the proper folk-wisdom
         punchline?...

         A hastily-arranged bombing run of Iraq could not detract from
         the fuck up last week, with Danny confusing 2.4Kbps with
         2400 baud in the ISDN piece, the luser. Of cause, baud means
         "symbols per second", so we *could* plead that that these
         days the byte is the - no? Bugger... in related spazmulery,
         we misspelt <a href="http://www.europa.com/~dogman/resume/">http://www.europa.com/~dogman/resume/</a> - and
         we're assured "weke" signifies "week" in your Earth
         language... we said Lufthansa, Feargal O'Farrell says
         LOO-nassa: let's call the DANCING AT LUGHNASA off... and
         finally, FUZZY GERDES added to Jay Gooby's earlier Wok Wok
         observations (what *is* it with transatlantic noodle
         consumers and their excellently onomatopoeic names?) by
         sending photographic evidence *proving* that American have
         little takeaway boxes for their "Asian" food.
