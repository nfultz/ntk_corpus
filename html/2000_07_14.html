</span><span class="item">         As NTK readers' attention spans collapse under the barrage
         of our saturation RIP coverage, we thought we'd enter a bit
         of a quiet period. But afore we go, one final glimpse at the
         one remaining pressure group still supporting the Bill:
         self-proclaimed protector of the kids, BARONESS THORNTON
         (wife of anti-RIP rentaquote, John Carr). In the dying
         moments of the Lords debate, the good Baroness launched a
         spectacular, and somewhat desperate, attack on critics of
         the Bill. To a rapt house, the Baroness unveiled a
         conspiracy in which RIP critics "would like to have the
         regime which exists in America, which is protected by the
         First Amendment and which has no constraints at all." And
         what could such extremism lead to? "In America, children are
         kidnapped. In America, there is no restriction on the
         paedophile activity which can take place... I do not want
         the Internet in the rest of the world to operate under that
         regime." Unfortunately for the Baroness, the kidnappers have
         already taken over by fooling us into signing the European
         Convention on Human Rights.  We'll see whether RIP makes it
         past that. Oh, and the eagle-eyed Baroness "noticed that not
         a single childcare organisation or organisation involved
         with the education of the young and their relationship to
         the Internet is involved in [the RIP] campaign." Well,
         Baroness, maybe you'd like to visit <a href="http://www.peacefire.org">www.peacefire.org</a>, where
         views of "the users with whom we are concerned - the
         children, the young and those who are vulnerable" are given.
         Weirdly, a lot of kids seem to quite like this free speech
         filth. Hope that doesn't mean you won't listen to what they
         have to say. Or give them a chance to say it.

                   - of course, RIP has little to do with Free Speech

</span><span class="item">         On the other hand, those God-fearing Yanks who regularly
         pepper Demon subscribers with accusations of Satanism must
         have felt vindicated this week, when DIS's ancient
         sacrificial pit at Finchley finally burst into flames.
         Recollections are a little confused: initial reports
         suggested that the remaining staff had self-immolated;
         subsequent enquiries showed it to be a tar boiler on the
         roof. Brave descriptions of company directors battling it
         out on the rooftops of North London contrast with more
         anonymous messages from Demon employees complaining about
         having to stand around in the rain. We did, though, like the
         dry Demon de-briefing report which paused in mid-drama to
         not that just as everyone was running around with
         extinguishers, "a passer-by came in through the front door
         and explained that the building was on fire". The man was
         thanked for his powers of observation. You see, all that
         diplomacy on demon.service proved useful after all...

         is "attending the event along with 19 other initiates". So, by 
         way of apology, this week we've pulled out all the stops to 
         find the dream assignment for NTK's core demographic: the OPEN 
         AUDITION FOR STAR TREK CREW MEMBERS - from 9am, Thu 2000-07-
         20, Science Museum, London. The positions involve showing 
         punters round the Museum's forthcoming "Star Trek: Federation 
         Science" exhibition from Sept 2000 to April 2001. Salary 
         (full- or part-time) is a Ferengi-esque UKP6.07 per hour 
         though "all successful applicants will be provided with Star 
         Trek costumes" (wear it to the audition if you've already got 
         one); candidates should additionally bring a CV, a 200-word 
         piece on "What I see the role of a Star Trek Crew Member at 
         the Science Museum to be", and - presumably - an inability to 
         distinguish fantasy from reality.

         *could* do without Mozilla's built-in WYSIWIG HTML editor,
         Mail handler, News reader, IRC client, xterm replacement,
         run-time XML UI interpreter, cross-platform high-level C++
         widget set, and re-implementation from scratch of
         Microsoft's entire COM system, you can. And, thank God,
         someone has. GALEON is a Gnome application that uses Chris
         Blizzard's minimalist wrapper around the Mozilla HTML
         rendering routines. It's little. It's fairly stable. It
         takes less than an hour to load. It lets you look at Web
         pages. Think of it as salvage.

         the film's full of wacky continuity errors ignored by style-
         over-content director Scott, then over-analysed by detective-
         mystery-crazed fans... almost exactly a month and 2 years 
         since its last orbit comes above-average Arthur C Clarke 
         adaptation TRAPPED IN SPACE (12.10am, Sat, BBC1)... and C5

         classic ELECTRAGLIDE IN BLUE (12.30am, Sat, C5) - not based 
         around the Apollo 440 album of the same name... even their own

         the "best" e-business ideas sent in to THE E-MILLIONAIRE SHOW

         final, helpfully preceded the day before by laboured historo-
         analogy WHEN MONEY WENT MAD: THE STORY OF THE SOUTH SEA BUBBLE

         McCall hosts overhyped survival-webcam yawn BIG BROTHER (9pm,

         our dismissal of M:I2 [NTK 2000-07-07], the "slow-mo kung-fu, 
         gravity-defying stunts, and 'Sydney' locations" leading him to 
         the inevitable conclusion: "It's the first film to be set in 
         'The Matrix' universe!"... while MG MILLER irresistibly 
         combined two of NTK's ongoing fixations by pointing out that 
         Robbie Williams' new single "sounds a bit like" the theme tune 
         from best-selling Amazon video "Chorlton And The Wheelies": 
         <a href="http://www.chorltonandthewheelies.co.uk/sounds/chorlton.wav">http://www.chorltonandthewheelies.co.uk/sounds/chorlton.wav</a> -

         Shooting Stars' "George Dawes" and former Creme Egg spokesman 
         MATT LUCAS slammed last week's NESTLE EXPLODING ZOOM sighting, 
         stating they were "actually available last year. I like them", 
         before going on to recommend ROLO BISCUITS: "a delight [which] 
         far outpleasure the Rolo" (well, the new ones are about 6 
         times the size)... perhaps inspired by BBC2's "Simpsons" night 
         [NTK 2000-06-16], CHRIS TAYLER took it upon himself to contact 
         capalert.com directly over the toon's suitability for family 
         viewing - and they wrote back, warning of "extreme adolescent 
         arrogance against fair parental authority, blatant promotion 
         of freedom from accountability and consequences, too much 
         independence and autonomy too soon for adolescents, many lies 
         about nuclear power, full male rear cartoon nudity"... while, 
         finally, ex-'The Word' presenter ALAN CONNOR thanked us for 
         highlighting screenit.com , where he enjoys gems like "this 
         soundtrack from the movie, Grosse Pointe Blank contains very 
         few examples of objectionable content" - "not including," Alan 
         notes, "the fact that the first minute includes the Violent 
         Femmes' 'Blister In The Sun', a paean to wanking"... but we're 
         sure this is just the tip of the iceberg. Have you tricked a 
         well-meaning Christian reviewer into unwittingly advocating 
         self-abuse? If so, NTK would like to hear from you...
