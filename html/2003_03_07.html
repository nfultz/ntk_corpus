</span><span class="item">         Time was when the music industry could just put any old
         rubbish in a press release and have the media and MPs parrot
         it verbatim the next day. That time, of course, was last
         week. This week, however, things are looking just a little 
         better. MPs debating the Communications Bill on Tuesday got 
         sidetracked into an almost honest discussion of "internet 
         piracy". With all the sleek coolness of dancefloor dads,
         they found themselves admitting to unauthorised home-taping
         in their crazy, reprobate past. And if you can plough
         through the high-larious puns on constituency names and
         reams of rote concern over our creative industries and the
         moral decline of youth, there's actually a faint whiff of
         clue hanging over the proceedings. They can't remember his
         name, but Jon Johansen is cited as the devisor of a Linux
         DVD reader. Micropayments are touted, "apocalyptic visions"
         are dismissed, the EUCD sceptically eyed. Now all we have to
         do is set them up an internal phpforum where they can
         fair-use photoshop each other's publicity photos, and then 
         they'll really start to understand.

</span><span class="item">         POPBITCH are asking for money again - blimey, that UKP2500 
         they raised from their last server appeal (April 2001) didn't 
         last very long, did it? To be honest, we prefer this approach 
         to the alternative of trying to get readers to subscribe to 
         something with no guarantee of how long it'll keep going 
         (apparently the current business model for Salon), but most 
         people who go for a "tip jar" revenue stream at least try to 
         give some indication of where your money is going. You know: 
         bandwidth, unexpected credit card bills, breast enlargements, 
         that sort of thing. Popbitch has classified and banner ads, 
         high-class web hosting at a nuclear bunker, an "office" in 
         London's fashionable Farringdon, and a founder who is now 
         editor of EMAP's "The Face" magazine, just down the road in  
         EC1. But all they tell you for their new appeal is the vague  
         muttering that the site "needs money to continue". You know, 
         if they'd just say they needed a fancy showbiz lawyer to keep 
         them out of jail for another year, our cheque would already 
         be in the post.

</span><span class="item">         It's nice to see the BBC's new media wing make at least a
         partial show of publishing their license-funded research for
         the rest of the industry (who pay their license fees too -
         well, most of them). Like, for instance, their recent
         Accessibility study which took some hard-hitting looks at
         the BBC's own reach to those with disabilities or just
         really dumb terminals. It's actually quite a decent
         Nielsenesque overview of why every site should be accessible
         in a usefully pointy-headed prose. Stuff you've been trying
         to tell your boss for ages - like the evils of wanton
         javascript, Flash, colour schemes, and PDF files.
         Admittedly, the research is only meant for "suppliers" to
         the sprawling media duchy, not riff-raff looking to scam
         tips for their own shamefully commercial ventures - but hey,
         no-one's stopping you, right? Well, apart from the BBC
         themselves. The BBC put it all in PDF format. Gee, good 
         thing they're not expecting any disabled suppliers to help 
         out, isn't it?

</span><span class="item">         Rael Dornfest's blogging utility BLOSXOM is Perl code
         written as when the world was young, and Perl code had
         something to prove: two hundred lines of yogically back-bent
         hack designed to do one thing, and do it well. You have a
         directory. The text files in the directory are your blog
         entries, sorted by timestamp. Pop a few HTML templates in
         there, and Blosxom CGIs it all into a viewable page complete
         with permalinks and other blog miscellany. Now with the
         imminent arrival of BLOSXOM 2.0, the script has developed
         "look at me! I can put my whole fist in my mouth!"
         extensibility. The new Blosxom plugins API is just a wodge
         of Perl packages that support a handful of obvious callbacks
         and tootle with variables. But it works - well enough to
         have spawned over fifty extensions to the basic app, from
         automatic smartquotes to trackbacks to debian package tags.
         The main script is still just your bog-standard CGI script
         (though it can now generate static as well as dynamic blog
         pages), and you're still just sticking text files in
         directories (although sub-directories now work like
         fancy-schmancy Moveable Type-like categories). It's blogging
         if blogging was a shell command - right down to its
         unpronounceable name.
