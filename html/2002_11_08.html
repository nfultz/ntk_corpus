</span><span class="item">         UK.COM, the slightly silly but popular para-TLD, disappeared
         briefly from the Net this week. The reason, as ever in
         DNSland, was a combination of overearnestness and mild
         incompetence that slowly escalated until it hit Verisign,
         home of *fantastic* incompetence. It started with spamcop
         and rfc-ignorant.org deciding they'd seen spam from a
         *.uk.com domain - and therefore, uk.com were responsible.
         Their bots checked the uk.com admin details - and, by a
         quirk, failed to find a valid mailserver. So they reported
         uk.com as having invalid whois details to a bot at ICANN.
         That bot turned and told Verisign. Of course, Verisign as
         the last port of call, had the sense to check with a huma -
         oh, what am I saying? Ten days after the first mistake,
         without apparently contacting uk.com by phone, post or mail,
         Verisign shut down the domain, killing thousands of other
         sites. Which presents an interesting denial of service
         attack on a domain: it seems if you can report to ICANN that
         a domain's details are wrong, there's a good chance of it
         escalating until your victim has vanished from the Net.
         Heck, just reporting a fake spam might do it. ICANN and
         Verisign updated the DNS root hints file this week, for the
         first time in five years. If only we could send them the
         occasional hint back.

</span><span class="item">         DAVID DOCHERTY, MD for Broadband at Telewest, novelist, and
         thinker, writes to declare that he "loathes spam".
         Consequently, he (and the company he hired, YourRelease.com)
         simply hadn't planned on sending hundreds of posts (which
         "looks like spam", he admits) to newsgroups worldwide using
         commercial spamming software at all. They were just trying
         to create a "War of The Worlds style drama," using fictional
         companies and a fake activist group to "create awareness of
         the issues" (and sell David's book). A volunteer, David
         says, acted irresponsibly. They're now drawing the drama to
         an early close, and deleting all the e-mail addresses they
         collected - perhaps realising at this late stage that
         fictional companies in particular have real problems
         complying with the Data Protection Act. Which leads us to
         wonder - given this was an ad campaign (and not a real activist
         spam), why was the agency employing "volunteers"? Are reality
         and fantasy beginning to blur in the telco industry? And if
         so - what, again?

</span><span class="item">         Thanks to everyone who responded to last week's appeal for
         someone to advise TV CREAM [see last week's NTK] - but don't
         worry if you haven't heard anything back from them yet, as the
         "creamies" are currently assembling a crack legal team to take
         on web-piracy repeat offenders The Daily Mail. Following on
         from that, this week's community interaction slot has been
         tailored to a couple of other interests we know to be popular
         among the NTK-reading demographic: obscure retro hardware and
         role-playing games. More specifically, reader JAMES WALLIS
         plans to "Create A Game In A Day" at his upcoming DRAGONMEET
         (from 10.30am, Sat 2002-11-30, Kensington Town Hall, London
         W8, UKP7) - but if you brought along a working Macintosh (or
         monitor) that they could use for this, you'd get a t-shirt and
         admission for free. Email the usual tips@spesh.com with the
         subject line "Return of the Mac" if you're interested. Though
         to be honest, we'd try to find a use for any old hardware
         you'd be prepared to loan - or if you don't especially want it
         back, perhaps build into a DIY recycling media centre. Or
         fully-autonomous walking battlemech, whichever seems easier.

         than usual, as heavy-handed multimillionaire MICHAEL MOORE
         brings not just his anti-gun documentary "Bowling For

         premier of his ONE AND A HALF MAN SHOW (various times, every

         that his TV show, isn't exactly a natural comedian, expect a
         somewhat more egalitarian pricing structure for the MARK

         until Wed 2002-12-11). Continuing the theme of "To each,

         rate", then think it stands for "Dance Dance Revolution",
         then start flip-flopping manicly between the two, comes
         PYTHON DANCE DANCE REVOLUTION, the high-level, ogg-wielding
         scripting dance game for Linux or Windows, a PS2-&gt;USB
         connector, and a DDR mat. For those who like their GPL'd
         rhythm games more polished - and platform specific - there's
         the Visual C++, but otherwise damn fine STEPMANIA 3.0, now
         with a vast world of skins, track editing, extra announcers
         and music files behind it. If you can *get* the music files,
         that is : our copyright overlords dictate that your
         favourite MP3 tracks be hidden away from sight, like escaped
         rebels or MAME files. But, hey, that's why it's called
         revolution, right?

         basis that everyone else goes on about Saturday morning kids'
         TV presenters, so does FAME SET AND MATCH (9.05pm, Sat,
         BBC2)... and it's not quite as exciting as David Fincher's
         "Se7en" or "Panic Room", but still worth watching THE GAME
