</span><span class="item">         Cupertino Kool-Aid - now in five delicious flavours! STEVE
         JOBS, CEO of the Thousand Year Interim, unveiled staggering
         new technical innovations at MacWorld, with five new types
         of plastic iMac cover. "We think", he declared, "the most
         important question this year is going to be: What is your
         favorite colo[u]r?". That bodes ill for anyone planning a
         decent conversation with a Mac user, but then, when did
         Apple product launchs ever help that? Collectors can now buy
         iMacs in strawberry, original blueberry, grape, lime and
         tangerine: all the colours of the Apple logo apart from, you
         can't help but notice, "lemon yellow". Unconnected research
         shows the new flashy G3s have beautiful organic lines, diddy
         little round mice, no SCSI support, no serial port and no
         floppy drive, but that's okay, because all the Mac
         peripheral manufacturers will be going bust trying to
         inventory all these new colours anyway. And what if you
         liked beige?

</span><span class="item">         Jobs also used the keynote to plug CONNECTIX's new
         Playstation emulator - an instant solution for the Mac game
         famine, he said. Connectix themselves were eyeing the exits.
         Scared silly of a pre-launch injunction by Sony, the company
         is now waiting for the cold hand of the multinational "fixers"
         to fall. Their unofficial defence, should anyone ask before
         shuriken-ing them to the walls and sending the pieces to
         Tokyo, is this: Given that Sony make a loss on the PSX
         itself and only make cash on game sales, they would be
         fools to sue, wouldn't they? Unless, that is, somebody
         points out that it's a *lot* easier to chip an emulator than
         a black box. Hell, out here in insecure platform land, you
         can't even tie down a pre-release PSX emulator beta for the
         PC without... I think we've said too much.

</span><span class="item">         And pity now, if you did not pity them before, the citizens of
         MILTON KEYNES. Many years ago, as a bright New Town, the
         planners decided on a municipal TV cable system, free for
         all. Economic fashions changed, though, from Maynard Keynes
         to Milton Friedman, and that monopoly was privatised - to
         that native son of the free market, British Telecom. They
         set about charging 30 quid a year - even though both
         satellite and RF alternatives were impossible for most
         Keynesians, due to restrictive planning regulations and poor
         signal strength. Imagine, then, the localised rejoicing when
         the EC demanded that BT sell its franchise. The bidding is
         up this month the MK's new Info-Laird. Surely anyone must be
         better than BT? Guess what, Milton Keynes? Microsoft wants
         the franchise. Oh, and Westminster? You're next.

</span><span class="item">         "It may not physically *be* a C64, but ethically it's
         similar" wrote one comp.sys.cbm revisionist about the
         WEB.IT. We spent forty-five seconds with one, physically if
         not ethically. Extensive tests show cover of box to be
         cardboard. Inside, it really does look like a C64 from a
         reality where the Amiga never happened. It has a C= key.
         It's got 16MB of RAM, 16MB ROM, and 2MB of flash ROM, but no
         hard drive. PCMCIA, pen pad and infrared, but you have to
         plug it into the telly. The CPU is an AMD variant called an
         ELAN (not an Enterprise Elan?), which broadly equates to a
         100Mhz 486. We have Lotus AmiPro, 1-2-3 Netscape 3.0, Lotus
         Organiser, IBM PC-DOS (yes!), and Windows 3.1 - oh, and that
         C64 emulator - in ROM. IBM, Lotus, Phoenix and AMD logos all
         over the box, but no mention of Microsoft, until you read
         the fine print that explains that Windows has been licensed
         by IBM courtesy of a legal loophole that Microsoft can do
         nothing about. Such pluck! Due in this country "uh, soon",
         at "uh, 300UKP? 400?". Doomed to fail. But what glorious
         protracted swansongs these Commodores machines do have.

         title borrowed, a la Knowing Me Knowing You, from an Abba
         song! The portents are, we're sorry to say, not good for
         dire-looking sex sitcom GIMME GIMME GIMME (9pm, Fri,
         BBC2)... oh, and maybe they should set up a helpline for
         those disappointed by the new series of freshly on-the-dole
         FRASIER (10pm, Fri, C4)... C5 strays into actual '70s
         soft-porn with EMMANUELLE (11.15pm, Fri, C5) to tempt you
         away from the story of sci-fi synthers The Human League on
         YOUNG GUNS (GO FOR IT) (11.20pm, Fri, BBC2) - apparently
         Phil Oakey found one of those singer girls "working as a
         waitress in a cocktail bar"... BBC2's "Time Season" warps
         between HG Wells classic THE TIME MACHINE (2.15pm, Sat,
         BBC2), mental perception docu WHAT MAKES US TICK (6.50pm,
         Sat, BBC2) and, further taunting dedicated fans, a
         completely out-of-sequence off-schedule flashback-based
         SEINFELD (12.05am, Sat, BBC2)... ITV a little more honest
         than usual about its peaktime offerings in
         transmission-blooper clip show TV NIGHTMARES (9pm, Sat,
         ITV)... and genuine serial fans will know that the "Scorpio"
         guy in DIRTY HARRY (10.15pm, Sat, ITV) is based on the
         real-life "Zodiac killer"... mysteriously, last year the BBC
         showed the movie version of STARGATE (7.25pm, Sun, BBC1)
         exactly 15 days later and 15 minutes earlier... it's a
         repeat, but Steve Coogan has never been funnier as when
         rabidly declaring I'M ALAN PARTRIDGE (10.40pm, Sun, BBC1)...
         sticking with lady-boys, unfortunate scheduling threatens to
         confuse anyone who tunes into the transsexual taxi driver in
         strange but funny THE LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN (9.30pm, Mon,
         BBC2) while looking for the transsexual prostitute in London
         docu-soap PADDINGTON GREEN (9.30pm, Mon, BBC1)... well, we
         didn't think the William Gibson episode of The X Files was
         that bad, at least compared to the hacker story in NASH
         BRIDGES (10.40pm, Mon, ITV)... and Ken Loach's KES (10pm,
         Mon, C4) depicts the tragedy of young geeks forced into
         amateur falconry before low-cost home computers became
         widely available... BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (6.45pm, Wed,
         BBC2) perks up again with the virgin Xander vs preying
         mantis episode... check <a href="http://www.schnews.org.uk/">http://www.schnews.org.uk/</a> for how
         train hijacking made THE MARK THOMAS COMEDY PRODUCT (11pm,
         Wed, C4) Britain's first light entertainment show with a
         nuclear capability... and attention all borderline-clinical
         musical prodigies! As SHINE proves (9.30pm, Thu, BBC1), all
         you need is a good woman to take you in, listen to your
         problems, then charge large crowds lots of money to come and
         see you...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; by now you should be aware of the rich
         disappointments within both STAR TREK: INSURRECTION (imdb:
         youth / based-on-tv-series / futuristic / honor / patriotism
         / sequel / spacecraft / space / star-trek) and gross
         made-for-TV Irvine Welsher THE ACID HOUSE (imdb:
         based-on-novel), but this week's releases bring even greater
         controversy... thoughtful but confused anti-American actioner
         THE SIEGE (imdb: army / bombing / cia / fbi / new-york /
         terrorism) has already caused US reviewers to question its
         depiction of "Marshal Law" (sic), while the second issue of
         "Arcade" magazine boldly and consistently spells the title
         as "The Seige"... Gus Van Sant puts the "Master" back into
         "Norman Bates" in his not entirely pointless PSYCHO (imdb:
         based-on-novel / controversial / cult-favorites / detective
         / dominant-mother / rain / masturbation-scene / money /
         mother / birds / dead / shower / house / murder / bathroom /
         psychological / stolen-money / swamp / thief / toilet /
         transvestitism) - a terrifying glimpse of what Hitchcock
         could have achieved if only he'd been able to draw on acting
         talent like Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn, had been able to
         film it in colour (wait a minute, it was 1960, he could
         have!), and had wanted to make it, inexplicably, much less
         frightening... London-release mental mayhem PI (imdb:
         paranoia / pi / self-mutilation / surreal / chaos-theory /
         computers / cult-favorites / delusion / judaism / low-budget
         / mathematical-equation / mathematics) is far from perfect,
         but steals from all the right places (a camera strapped to
         the hero's chest, Jim Flint's Habitus, Arthur C Clarke's The
         Nine Billion Names Of God). "Maybe Pi is the name of God,"
         ponders one imdb comment. "Try pronouncing an infinite
         random number!"... but infinitely preferable to Jane
         Horrocks's follow-up to impersonating the whole Eastenders
         cast in her stupid LITTLE VOICE (imdb: based-on-play). This
         time she sings in such unerring mimicry of Judy Garland,
         Shirley Bassey, Marilyn Monroe etc that you're convinced
         it's lip-syncing - wouldn't it have been cleverer to have
         her doing songs that *they never actually sang* in their
         distinctive style, like genius Elvis tribute act, The
         King?...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         THEY TRIED TO LAY THEIR "FOUL EGGS" IN OUR MOUTHS&gt;&gt; the
         NESTLE ROLO COOKIES 'N' CARAMEL EGG is at least a step in
         the right direction, but CADBURY continue senseless
         experimentation in the form of their sickly oversweet ORANGE
         EGG - like the standard Creme Egg (or Velvet - see [NTK
         1998-01-23], but stuffed with yucky choccy-box filling...
         continuing the Alien theme, big tip for '99 is CADBURY'S
         YOWIE, the eco-friendly incitement to "collect a series of
         easy-to-assemble replica creatures from within the chocolate
         tummies of the lovable Yowie characters"... our current
         chief source of Phenylalanine? HORLICKS MALTISSIMO low-cal
         instant chocolate drink, available in plain, Mocha or
         Tiramisu (can't wait for Buddy Holly TV ad: "if you knew/
         Tiramisu"), and price-fighting those innumerable OPTIONS and
         a CADBURY'S CARAMEL CHOCOLATE BREAK hybird we spotted
         briefly last year... roving snack spotter LEE MAGUIRE is
         first to report the truly dramatic sounding CRUNCHIE
         EXPLOSION (UKP0.38): honeycomb slab replaced with
         "granules", of which 7 per cent are Space Dust-style
         "popping candy". Subject describes the experience as
         "fantastic, like eating a Crunchie while it's still
         alive"... while we await further confirmation of MATT
         LOCKE's sighting of the (biscuit-free?) MUNCHIES BAR
         (UKP1.20) - not to be confused with the shameless
         counter-intuitive downsizing of MONSTER MUNCH: "From now
         on, Monster Munch will come in New Bitesize, so there will
         be more pieces in every bag, ensuring even more monstrous
         fun every time!"... on the streets (of London at least):
         redecoration of tasteful SEATTLE COFFEE HOUSEs as garish
         STARBUCKS has begun, also slight price hike in the form of
         discarded "small" size (though apparently they still have it
         if you ask)... this month's taste abomination: even SMARTIES
         (UKP0.30) aren't revealing what their new "Mystery Blue
         Flavour" is supposed to be, because it's part of a
         competition to win 100 PlayStations. Our current best guess:
         blueberry bubblegum. Our backup option: just revolting...
