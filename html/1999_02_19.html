</span><span class="item">         Physics news: BRUCE PERENS, one of the co-creators of the
         Open Source(TM) movement, recanted this week, and announced
         in a burst of highly-energised e-mails that it *should* be
         called Free Software after all. Alarmingly, this means
         Bruce is now resigning from non-profit organisations faster
         than he can found them: a self-sustaining chain reaction
         that could well lead to him splitting his own body into its
         constituent atoms. Watch for the resultant explosion on the
         usual mailing lists: as ever, we're expecting a huge
         release of light, heat, sound, nervous energy - but
         strangely, no additional code. Which is odd, because that's
         what all these efforts was supposed to generate.

</span><span class="item">         Pleasing largely for its sense of closure: you remember how
         the EU thought that storing someone's IP number might
         violate their data protection privacy? (Bad EU! No idea
         about networking!) And how DIXONS FREESERVE alarmed
         innocent users by demanding to see their CLIDs before
         letting them email? (Bad Dixons! Encouraged us to make
         numerous "CLID" jokes!) Yet two wrongs do seem to make a
         right: a new Australian ruling could forbid ISPs down under
         from collecting users' caller ID, stating that it
         represents an unacceptable intrusion. Well, if there's a
         worldwide flood of spam promoting Fosters and Vegemite, you
         know who to blame.

         week of the European Parliament's cache row - why not check
         out their own EP NEWS (free with today's Independent). A
         monthly round-up of all the EP has achieved (on *four*
         tabloid sides!). It identifies the threat from "portable
         double-deck copying machines" (swift reaction to
         technological change, there) and "sophisticated technical
         devices able to surf the net and download music files at
         the drop of a hat without so much as a thank-you to the
         recording artist" (generally we call them PCs). And that
         the levy on blank media is "not even a tax where the payer
         has no control how the money is spent". Euro MP Carole
         Tongue thinks the tax will help artists living on the
         breadline - ironic since unsigned musicians would probably
         receive less from the tax than they'd pay just to
         distribute their own demo cassettes. NTK is currently
         lobbying for a tax on fan-fold paper.

         you can check out cheery New Scientist journo SIMON INGS in
         the "meat" at his various readings, speakings and signings
         around the country - often in friendly symbiosis with
         fellow Brit-sciffers Michael Marshall Smith and Stephen
         Baxter, and culminating in the terrifying-sounding
         "Fabulous Harbours" night at Heffers in Cambridge (1999-03-
         10), which also features Kim Newman (Britain's own Jack
         Womack?) and Tom Holt (the poor man's Robert Rankin, if
         such a thing is possible). In an act of cranial-jack-like
         telepathy, when we asked Simon's press agent for any
         "coming events", she uploaded his entire itinerary: to
         discourage any cyber-stalkers out there, we've spared you
         his precise train schedule and details of "light supper
         with Steve Farrar of the Sunday Times".

         like Fonzie. And what's Fonzie like?" Uh... COOL? MS
         dropping Java always seemed an empty threat while it was
         the only sane way of using their Component Object Model, but
         now plans for an alternative has reached that media-
         critical "code name" phase. Provisionally dubbed "C++ Object
         Oriented Language" (no, Bjarne Stroustrup didn't know what
         that implies about C++ either) it "makes C++ programming
         simpler". What? Messing with the one thing that keeps C++
         coders above VB'ers in the programming pecking order? And
         how "simple" will it be persuading Java database-app
         developers to jump to a new language tied to a specific OS
         and object model? Hey, according to the plan, by the time
         Windows2000 gets deployed, that silly "cross-platform"
         concept will be moot anyway.

         presumably not sponsored by the alcoholic beverage of the

         BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (6.40pm, Wed, BBC2)... and,

         densest, darkest, most deeply disturbing sci-fi of the year
         (we hope): KW Jeter's NOIR (RRP 6.99, Amazon 4.79) chops
         out the still-thrashing nervous systems of his previous Dr
         Adder, Farewell Horizontal and mashes them in with the bits
         they wouldn't let him put in Blade Runner 2. Is he really
         proposing that warez doodz should be killed and have their
         brains put into hi-fi cables? Net searches reveal: yes he
         is... cutting himself a slice of that bestselling Rough
         Guide To The Internet pie, Jim McClellan's CD-sized
         GUARDIAN GUIDE TO THE INTERNET (RRP 6.99, Amazon 5.59)
         seems aimed at people who consider themselves too smart,
         liberal, or smooth for the "Rough" one. Occasionally FTP-
         obsessed, replete with authentic "Grauniad" typos ("url to
         follow" p27; "Net myths decontructed" p40; cyberpunk /
         cypherpunk confusion p51), but he plugs NTK at least 3
         times (p38; p336, p428), so he must have some idea... Simon
         Ings' HEADLONG (RRP 5.99, Amazon 4.79) doesn't quite
         overcome its moon-based, ruined-London, Neuromancer-
         'fluenced, Greg Egan-lite nano-gineering gimickry, but much
         better than this "early version" would had you believe
         <a href="http://www.omnimag.com/archives/fiction/openvein/">http://www.omnimag.com/archives/fiction/openvein/</a> ... not
         much humour-to-page transfer in either Woody Allen's thick
         COLLECTED PROSE (RRP 7.99, Amazon 6.39) or Steve Martin's
         128-page PURE DRIVEL (RRP 9.99, Amazon 7.99), while THE
         SEINFELD SCRIPTS (RRP 9.99, Amazon 7.99) are sadly limited
         to just first and second series; only really mastered its
         domain in seasons 3 and 4 (see - appallingly commented -
