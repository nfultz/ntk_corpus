</span><span class="item">         As indentured servants on the Murdoch plantation, we're
         obliged to cover the launch of SKY DIGITAL as our headline
         story. Catastrophically for them, no-one invited us to the
         UKP1million party, making their stupid new service nothing
         more than bunch of Digera-doo-box losers with a "mmm I'm a
         first adopter how many Discovery channels can I take in one
         go, mmm?" rip-off starter pack, especially that [.tv]
         rubbish. Now, what's the excuse of the websites for Capital
         Radio and the Daily Star? They replaced their front pages
         with 640x480 Sky banner ads, praising the revolution in
         television non-viewing to the heights. An astounding
         rebranding, given that the Capital site consists almost
         entirely of attempts to establish its own micro-brand, and
         the Daily Star is actually owned by United News &amp; Media,
         sworn enemy of Murdoch and investor in competing multiplex,
         SDN. So, how much does the front page of your flagship site
         cost? Would 50,000UKP sound about right?

</span><span class="item">         A few branding cock-ups with BT's big launch too.
         BTClickPlus, as the penny-a-minute, dead-on-arrival Net
         service is now called, launched yesterday to a chorus of
         slapped foreheads. Not only has that whole Dixons thing
         queered the pitch, but - it seems - Oftel insisted that the
         service have the "Plus" suffix added (so competing telcos
         can make clicking noises too?). Continuing the naming
         disasters, BT launched <a href="http://www.talk21.com">www.talk21.com</a>, their hotmail-clone
         which manages to incorporate the worst aspect of freemail
         systems - those stupid numbers at the end of your username -
         INTO THE ADDRESS ITSELF. Fans of BT senior management
         figures immediately grabbed the two most promising usernames
         - <a href="mailto:peter.cochrane@talk21.com">peter.cochrane@talk21.com</a>, and <a href="mailto:ian.vallance@talk21.com.">ian.vallance@talk21.com.</a>
         "Ian" even e-mailed the head of the service, and asked him
         to phone his enclosed mobile immediately. Which he did. And
         was very put out when "Ian" turned out not to be the MD of
         BT, but a normal punter. On a Cellnet phone.

</span><span class="item">         BACKSPACE, the relaxing Net club in London's medieval
         district, has a problem. Not the most affluent of dives, and
         still some centuries away from that lucrative public
         offering, they've always had a bit of a slack server
         presence. Well, after scraping enough money to buy a Sun
         Ultra-1, they spent three weeks moving over the many
         non-profit Websites they've hosted for years. Then, a couple of
         Apache conf file statements away from going live, those
         bloody London Sun thieves popped in and took it to wherever
         all these boxes are going. Unlike the ICA, whom we hate,
         Backspace don't have any sponsors or insurance, and are now
         stuffed. So here's their plea: if you've got a spare
         box, and want to put the Web space back into Backspace,
         contact Harl at the address below. They haven't said what
         the reward would be, but I reckon it'll work out at free
         lifetime membership and guest of honour status at the NTK
         Christmas party (right guys?)

         accounts, and multiple pops, and even a freebie shell
         account, but if you want to point your domain where you
         wish, you'd still have to talk a Bastard Operator from Hell
         into giving you a DNS record. Until, that is, now. Well,
         actually, the PUBLIC DNS Server has been around for
         ages, but we've only just spotted it, and a straw poll said
         that not many others knew about it either. Granite Canyon
         lets you insert your A and MX records for your domain into
         their server, pointing where'er you want, for free. Simply
         register your domain with your local NIC, nominate the
         correct NS servers, and away you go. Downside? Well, you do
         still have to know what A and MX records are, which
         practically makes you BOFH yourself: but then, all newbies

         irritating Arabella Weir in Hunter &amp; Docherty ad agency
         sitcom THE CREATIVES (10pm, Fri, BBC2) - not quite the
         Absolutely reunion we were hoping for... but - wheel out the

         starting with Yes / Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer tracing their
         ROCK FAMILY TREES (11.15pm, Fri, BBC2), and continuing with
         a whole Roger Dean landscape's-worth of MUSIC MACHINE
         (4.45pm, Mon-Fri not Wed, Radio 3)... BBC2 gets "Knievel" on
         your ass by devoting EVEL NIGHT (8.55pm, Sat) to the cult
         '70s accident victim... C5 makes a near-identical copy of
         the theme night idea in its CLONE ZONE weekend - with

         (7pm, Sun, C5), and docu THE CLONE RANGERS (8pm, Sun, C5)

         cute casting (Linda Hamilton, Liv Tyler) fail to get much

         ITV)... http animal Tim Berners-Lee sure to enliven the
         final GLORY OF THE GEEKS (8pm, Sat, C4)... and secret
         origins of The Lone Gunmen should stop it from seeming like
         it's been 100 episodes of the same old bloody X FILES
         (9.25pm, Sat, BBC1)... man unjustly convicted on evidence
         that he enjoys sitcoms, eats cake, lives with mum, in
         above-average Brit TV movie A LIFE FOR A LIFE (9pm, Sun,

         "information revolution" series CONNECTED (11.40pm, Mon, C4)
         - be patient, they get around to Alan Cox eventually... hard
         to imagine how they'll get a '90s romance element into
         largely faithful 18th century seagoing saga HORNBLOWER (8pm,
         Wed, ITV)... and suitably punishing self-mutilation footage
         makes you ask: who is the real "sick man" in SICK: THE LIFE
         AND DEATH OF BOB FLANAGAN, SUPERMASOCHIST (11.30pm, Thu, C4)

         secret-service / based-on-novel / puzzle / drama / codes /
         murder / undercover / secret-agent) it's steganographically
         buried deep in standard action cliches... is it just us, or
         does the Shockwaved site for Brit-made Northern Ireland
         journo-violence farce DIVORCING JACK (imdb: based-on-novel /
         belfast / ireland / murder / politicians / black-comedy)
         look just like the beginning of the You Don't Know Jack
         CD-ROM game?... a wider than usual release (ELIZABETH's
         kingdom only reaches London) for the exceptionally odd
         BUFFALO '66 (imdb: kidnapping / drama / comedy / road /
         football), though its plot - convict grabs Christina "Addams
         Family" Ricci, pretends she's his wife - surely risks
         attracting "the wrong element", if you know what we mean...

         already have purchased the entire UK stock of SHINY ADIDAS
         TRACKSUITS AND THE DEATH OF CAMP (Berkeley Boulevard,
         US$14.00), the best-of compilation from San Francisco's
         erratically brilliant, now-deceased Might Magazine (imagine
         a well-written, less insufferably posh version of The
         Idler)... reassuringly, it even has a Michael Moore-style
         attack on the ever-admirable - yet ultimately disappointing
         - Michael Moore ("How do you explain your success as a
         political humorist when you know nothing about politics and
         you're only occasionally funny?"). MM's recycling skills
         once again come to the fore in his new tell-all
         behind-the-scenes self-aggrandising ADVENTURES IN A TV
         NATION (Boxtree, UKP9.99) - "Most of the 10 million people
         who watched our show couldn't figure out how the hell we
         snuck this thing on TV"... ricketiest bandwagon of the month
         hauls in TOM CLANCY'S NET FORCE (Hodder Headline, UKP6.99 -
         4.99 in Tesco's), an awesomely anachronistic attempt to set
         Clancy thriller cliches in a) the year 2010, and b) at least
         partly in VR. Regular NTK start-quote provider Lloyd Wood
         highlights the extent of AOLer Clancy's research at
         <a href="http://www.xprize.org/press/clancy.html.asp">http://www.xprize.org/press/clancy.html.asp</a> , where personal
         computers were co-invented by one "Bob Wazniak"... and good
         to see fan webmasters Curtis Saxon and Robert Brown getting
         a credit at the back of upcoming STAR WARS INCREDIBLE
         CROSS-SECTIONS (Dorling Kindersley, UKP12.99) - though this
         slim volume (32 pages) fails to acknowledge their more
         controversial conclusions, like the Ewok extermination
         caused by the nuclear-winter destruction of Death Star II

           "Hi! This is the ezmlm program. Remember me? I used to
           manage the ntknow@lists.ntk.net mailing list. Now I'm here
           in downtown Kosovo, explaining the details of my mail
           bounce probe to trigger-happy conscript snipers.  Thanks
           to the NTK guys for sorting out the new gig! I also love
           all the mail I got after I told every subscriber that they
           were about to be thrown off NTK if they failed to obey my
           incomprehensible instructions.  Thanks, one and all! I
           think my favourite was from "Mil" from Wolverhampton
           University, who wrote 'What the hell does all that mean,
           then? Should I start hoarding canned food in the cellar?'
           I'm not sure, Mil - although my masters do tell me that I
           was suffering from "resource starvation" at the time, so
           maybe it's me who needs the food!!! Haha. Well, time to
           doff the fluorescent target suit and go dance in the
           street again.  Love you all!  Write soon! Failure to do so
           will need to your removal from the list without further
           notice!! Byeee! xxxx - ezmlm"
