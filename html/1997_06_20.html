         palmtop out of their sleeves. It costs from 400 to 500UKP,
         with an almost full-action keyboard, stylus-sensitive
         screen, and up to 8 meg RAM into about the same size as the
         now-discounted Series 3. Early impressions are broadly
         positive (big apps compared to PalmPilots, plug-and-go PC
         connectivity), let down by a couple of indicators (no Mac
         cables, no Net software) that maybe they rushed it out to
         beat the Windows CE machines to market.

</span><span class="item">         IRIDIUM LLC, the bazillion low-orbit satellites zooming

         its forthcoming service. The 66 satellite network will
         provide global mobile communications by 1998: receivers
         will cost $2000-$3000 with single channel data speeds at
         2400Kbps. Sound dull? That must be why investors Motorola
         immediately announced details of the new CELESTRI system, a
         much more exciting, 63 satellite, $750 receiver, super
         high-speed broadbandy kind of Internet thang. Competitors
         Teledesic say Motorola is pre-announcing to spread Fear
         Uncertainty and Doubt against Teledesic's own whizz-bang
         288 satellite monster, which won't boot up until 2002.
         Teledesic is part-owned by Bill Gates, so they know anti-
         competitive behaviour when they see it.

         (which spurt green ooze) rather than the red-blooded human
         pedestrians featured in preview versions of the game. The
         change seems unlikely to affect the title's high review

         Vorderman (the real-life Sarah Connor?) continues her one-
         woman war on technology in TESTING TESTING (8.30pm, Fri,
         ITV) and new Tomorrow's World spin-off HOT GADGETS (7.30pm,
         Wed, BBC1)... multinationals (well, BP, mainly) go to war
         in WORLD IN ACTION (8pm, Mon, ITV)... and spoof
         rockumentary 500 BUS STOPS (11.15pm, Tue, BBC2) sounds like
         a rather long half hour in the company of John Shuttleworth
         (think Harry Hill with a Casio)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES &gt;&gt; Even if you've never heard of foul-mouthed uber-
         geek Howard Stern, it's probably worth going to shock-jock
         biopic PRIVATE PARTS simply to salute him for his on-air
         savaging of rank amateur Chris Evans... even Brad Pitt
         didn't much like simplistic IRA drama THE DEVIL'S OWN (Brad
         Pitt, Harrison Ford)...  while INTIMATE RELATIONS (Julie
         Walters, Rupert Graves) is one for all you fans of British
         tragedies of sexual obsession set in the 1950s...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MAGS &gt;&gt; The August issue of US satire mag SPY (about UKP2
         from most big newsagents, also branches of Tower Records)
         has Gillian Anderson on the front, and a spot-on manifesto
         of "pulp science" inside - "while knowing the truth can be
         unusually gratifying, having a *theory* is a more than
         passable alternative"... back in the UK, Fortean spin-off
         BIZARRE struggles on with a "special sex issue" (not
         usually a good sign?)... Britain's Factsheet 5, BYPASS #7
          arrives on our doorstep, and we like: over 500 zines
         reviewed by non-lunatics: #1.20 from Bypass, PO Box 148,
         Hove, BN3 3DQ... check out PLAYSTATION PLUS for its article
         on how to "chip" your PSX - maybe they're planning on
         launching "wArEz d00dZ m0nThLy"...
