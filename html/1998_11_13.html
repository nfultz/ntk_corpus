</span><span class="item">         All the .com's disappeared again this Wednesday, but this
         time NETWORK SOLUTIONS had an explanation. According to
         David Holtzmann, NSI vice president of engineering, it
         wasn't their fault: it was the "F" root nameserver that went
         rogue. And that's run by Net legend, Paul Vixie.
         Unfortunately, Holtzmann seems to have been confusing
         Vixie's "F" rootserver, f.root-servers.net, and NSI's own
         "F" rootserver, f.gtld-servers.net, which they recently
         installed in Palo Alto (right next to Vixie's) to
         considerable fanfare. As it happens, Vixie's server *was*
         corrupted (NSI's machines messed up the file transfer), but
         correctly told DNS servers that it was down.  Unfortunately,
         NSI's F, J, or K servers were snafu'd too, and were proudly
         insisting to the world that they were fine, just fine, and,
         by the way, did you know every .com in the universe just
         vanished? It's still not clear why NSI called their server
         "F" after the same letter as Vixie's long-established
         machine: some cynical voices suggested at the time that they
         were trying to squeeze out the old boys. Or maybe they
         just haven't got the hang of this whole "naming" business yet.

         Squeal, aka the one-legged guy with the big hair who informed
         on Kevin Mitnick, has done a bunk. FBI marshalls have been
         checking his usual haunts on Sunset Boulevard, nervous that
         the running man won't be returning for his star witness
         appearance in the Mitnick trial. Mail to 2600 mag's Emmanuel
         Goldstein purporting to be from Petersen, claims he's
         skipped the country to work for some "CIA-funded black ops".
         Well, aren't we all? And will he be back for Mitnick? "Let
         lying dogs sleep" says the... uh, unconfirmed report.
         Meanwhile, we're wondering - wasn't it the *other* guy who
         had an arm missing in the Fugitive?

</span><span class="item">         TOMMY FLOWERS sounds like something from a Captain Britain
         comic: the cheerful engineer sidekick of Turing and the
         Bletchley Park eggheads. In reality, he was Dr Flowers, -
         the man behind the design of Colossus, the electronic
         processor that helped break German encrypted messages in
         WWII. Colossus, if not the first computer, certainly counts
         as one of the first electronic hacks: it was constructed
         almost entirely from standard telephone parts. Flowers also
         tweaked the cutting edge: he insisted on using fragile
         vacuum tubes, rather than relays - his experience at the GPO
         told him that if they just kept his machine turned on, the
         tubes would rarely blow. Oh, and Flowers upped the speed of
         the Colossus fivefold in two years, beating Moore's Law
         before it even began. Dr Flowers was 92 when he passed away
         earlier this month.

         at Bingley Hall, The Staffordshire Show Centre, Stafford,
         this Saturday 14/11/98 (1000-1600GMT). The simple bran of

         still cheery exponents. And we'll be breaking bread with the
         Atari's traditional enemies, too. By a happy coincidence
         the Atari Convention takes place at *exactly* the same time
         and place as the ALL COMPUTER SHOW, which will be
         chock-a-block with ageing Sinclair fans, Einstein
         enthusiasts, Coleco Adam advocates and, we're sure, the
         occasional Amiga loser. Entrance fee UKP3, and bring your

         you don't recognise the name: his DEMORONISER is a program
         that fixes symptoms you'll recognise even if you've never
         known the disease. This Perl hack fixes HTML generated with
         programs like PowerPoint and Microsoft Word, dropping back
         the apostrophes and smart quotes which the apps otherwise
         knacker beyond belief. As Walker points out, if you don't
         fix the code, Web readers using Macs or Unix will think
         you're an ungrammatical idiot or - worse - suspect you own
         PowerPoint and Microsoft Word. Walker was also the founder
         of AutoCad, and the guy in Rudy Rucker's THE HACKER AND THE

         would have you muttering GOODNESS GRACIOUS ME (10pm, Fri,
         BBC2) - if they weren't so excitingly, adventurously
         Asian... but at least they haven't scheduled it against the
         increasingly excellent sibling ribaldry of FRASIER (10pm,
         Fri, C4)... plus plenty of self-confessed "macho bullshit" -
         and a weirdly camp villain - in early Arnie guns-and-puns
         fest COMMANDO (10.25pm, Fri, BBC1) - "I let him go!"... not
         officially "girl power" night on the SciFi Channel, but
         clearly something's fuelling immortal-female spin-off
         HIGHLANDER: THE RAVEN (8.30pm, Fri, SciFi), the TOMB RAIDER
         SPECIAL (9.30pm, Fri, SciFi), and that other post-feminist
         (post-watchable?) icon TANK GIRL (10pm, Fri, SciFi)...
         desperate Cilla tries to find *any romance at all* in the
         lives of ex-contestants on THE BLIND DATE EXCLUSIVE (6.45pm,
         Sat, ITV)... *surely* Iranian hostages docu 444 DAYS (10pm,
         Sat, BBC2) will touch on the theory that Bush kept them
         there till Carter lost to Reagan... and, inexplicably, C4 is
         re-showing DARK SKIES (12.20am, Sat, C4; 11.50pm, Sun,
         C4)... visible wires, painted f/x, straight-faced Leslie
         Nielsen fail to detract from archetypal sci-fi classic
         FORBIDDEN PLANET (5.20pm, Sun, C4)... a comprehensive look
         back at the highlights of a month's digital TV in NOUGHTS
         AND ONE (8.50pm-9pm, Sun, BBC2)... seen John Dahl's
         neo-noirs Red Rock West or The Last Seduction? Then no need
         to KILL ME AGAIN (10pm, Sun, C4)... especially when Luc
         Besson is lamenting the uselessness of work experience
         placements in rapid-fire assassin assignment LEON (10.10pm,
         Sun, BBC2)... why should C5 viewers have all the fun, ask
         competing channels with completely educational, not at all
         sensation-seeking VICE - THE SEX TRADE (9pm, Mon, ITV), and
         - just after, on the same night! - ANATOMY OF DESIRE (10pm,
         Mon, C4)... 60 years of cereal box evolution compressed into
         10 mins of brand-nostalgia 6-parter WRAPPERS (10.20pm, Tue,
         BBC2) - part two free inside!... and it's rubbish sci-fi
         rip-off week on C5 - again - with The Relic-alike DNA (9pm,
         Tue, C5), and scary black contact-lens ad THE SILENCERS
         (9pm, Wed, C5)... has Davina McCall *killed* Gaby Roslin to
         take over all her old jobs, like THE REAL HOLIDAY SHOW
         (8.30pm, Wed, C4)?... and, for comparison's sake, CARRY ON
         CAMPING (11.15pm, Wed, BBC1) is followed by the second-worst
         British sex comedy of all time, pseudo-sci-fi
         penis-transplant sequel PERCY'S PROGRESS (12.40am, Wed,
         BBC1)... 

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; Buffy, Ultraviolet, Razor Blade Smile, John
         Carpenter, and now Wesley Snipes in frenetic beat-'em-up
         BLADE (imdb: based-on-comic / vampire) - just what have
         people got against the undead again all of sudden? "The
         whole film is bad right through," said the Jamaican Film
         Board, then banned it... lovely Sandra Bullock plays the
         local "Queen of Corn", directed by "King of Corn" Forest
         Whitaker, in chick-flick by numbers HOPE FLOATS (imdb:
         divorce / mother-daughter / old-age / photography /
         small-town / talk-show) - and if she'd seen The Philadelphia
         Experiment, she'd know not to trust that guy this time...
         Matthau and Lemmon together again - like they ever work with
         anyone else - in tottering THE ODD COUPLE II (imdb: divorce
         / marriage / odd-couple / road-trip / sequel) - imagine
         "Home Alone" with OAPs... and battle for the most
         vomit-packed movie of the week: is it Hal Hartley's
         limited-release touching scatological poetry web-publishing
         romp HENRY FOOL (imdb: drama/ comedy) - sounds oddly like
         John Waters' upcoming Pecker... or Terry Gilliam's
         nauseating f/x fest - with Benicio "Bakersfield PD" Del
         Toro, and Johnny Depp as what looks like a '70s Elton John -
         to elicit both FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS (imdb: 1970s /
         drugs / las-vegas / sequel). As Ben Moor puts it: To
         describe it as 'Gonzo' journalism is to ignore the influence
         of all the other muppets...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         DEAD TREE MEDIA&gt;&gt; yeah, we know, we did "magazines"
         recently, but we had to get the word out to someone: issue 1
         of much-trumpeted Future Publishing multi-format mag ARCADE
         (UKP1 launch price, due Tue 17/11/98) is, reportedly,
         "awful". Symptoms include Total Film design,
         ultra-impenetrable text (2000 words/page?), only 2 (out of
         73) games getting "below average" scores, 20 pages of tips,
         and a big cover close-up of Lara Croft's head with headline
         "The New Face Of Videogames" - clearly not a usage of "New"
         that we were previously familiar with. Intriguingly, the
         press ads - a charming tableau of two blokes playing games,
         chomping pizza, while bored girls look on - supports our
         long-standing claim that the mag was going to be called
         "Arcadia", as this is written on one of the joypads in black
         marker pen, presumably to prevent them from being nicked
         from the office... apparently the makers of Edge, OPM,
         Frontiers, Decoration Cake and the (perhaps too literal)
         Redline are also planning a "technology lifestyle mag",
         called CODE, described as "like Wired - but not so up its
         own arse" (and where did we hear that disclaimer before?)...
         in more encouraging news, <a href="http://www.salonmagazine.com">http://www.salonmagazine.com</a>
         reported that West Coast uberzine MIGHT is reincarnating as
         MCSWEENEY'S, helmed by David Eggers, author of "Never Fucked
         Anyone", the best bit in the Might book by far. Further info
