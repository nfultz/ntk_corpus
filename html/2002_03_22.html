</span><span class="item">         So, you're a small company: you've got a private dial-in for
         the office network and it's ex-directory (natch). With
         war-dialling a little trickier in the UK than the States, it
         should be pretty well hidden from crackers, right? Not if
         one of your employees switches his tariff to BT Together, it
         isn't. It appears that BT's so paranoid about subscribers
         using its unlimited call service for Net connections, that
         it's been automatically flagging any line that gets a lot of
         incoming BT Together data calls as an "ISP". Result: your
         employee gets a huge phone bill (ISPs are excluded from the
         flat-rate deal). And you get your private dial-in number
         listed on the public "ISP exclusion" Webpage. Together, we
         note, with around 5000 other juicy data lines, just ready
         for a cracker to step dandily through. Thanks BT! Putting
         people first: right after "profits", about five pages before
         "privacy", and a whole private phone directory or two ahead
         of "security".

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         No need to worry about the London Underground getting hacked
         [see last week's NTK] if their smartcard tickets are as
         security conscious as the official THETUBE.COM site, where
         "no" responses to their "Do you want a Public Private
         Partnership?" poll have inexplicably continued to "soar" all
         week. Disregarding the possibility that the public might
         actually agree with area mayor Ken Livingstone on this
         controversial matter, TheTube.Com seems more inspired by the
         Robert Mugabe school of democracy and has already declared one
         set of results "flawed", resetting them to earlier values "to
         restore the integrity" of the poll. "It seems some people will
         do anything to win - fair or foul", the site complains,
         presumably not referring to its own scrupulously impartial
         voting options: "YES: London Underground says: no more delay -
         let's get on with fixing the Tube" or "NO: Transport
         Commissioner Bob Kiley says that he wants to go back to court
         to block PPP". "This is a subject that needs proper debate,
         not vote-rigging by lobbyists", they conclude - so we do hope
         it hasn't occurred to any of those lobbyists to circulate the
         voting URL with arguments like, say, "quickpoll.asp?vt=no".

</span><span class="item">         It's reassuring to see a publicly-funded body like the BBC not
         being swayed by last week's X-Box launch hype - well, it would
         be, if they didn't seem to be completely obsessed with Metal
         Gear Solid 2 on the PS2 instead. "Games designer pushes
         boundaries" they revealed on March 4, swiftly followed by
         "Movie soundtracks come to gaming" (March 5), "Blockbuster
         game set to break records", (March 8), and indeed "Solid sales
         for Metal Gear" (March 11). And that's despite the somewhat
         disappointing comments of "Metal Gear 2 lacks solidity" (March
         8) and "Metal Gear Solid 2: Your views" (also March 8). The
         stealthy PR infiltration goes deeper than you'd think:
         apparently they've been looking forward to the release ever
         since the "Zone Of The Enders" demo moved their reviewer "to
         tears" around this time last year...

         LAN PARTY (from 9am, Fri 2002-03-29, Newbury racecourse, UKP70
         per participating PC) certainly paints an idyllic picture of
         an event attended by "girls and women", "whole families" and
         "lots of father/son combinations". They're hoping this broad
         appeal may make them the UK's "first ever" 1000-player event
         - that and &lt;1ms ping-times for Counterstrike, Q3 Arena, Star
         Trek Voyager: Elite Force, Unreal Tournament, Return To Castle
         Wolfenstein and many other popular family pastimes. After all,
         the Christian feast of the resurrection co-opts older pagan
         traditions of renewal and rebirth, and what better way to
         celebrate that than with a frenzy of deathmatch respawning?

</span><span class="item">         THE PERL REVIEW is certainly *not* the open source
         replacement for the excellent Perl Journal, currently
         embedded as a trophy supplement in SysAdmin magazine. Oh no.
         But what it currently *is* is the St. Andrews of PERL GOLF.
         Perl Golf is the ancient recreation of Perl Monks and
         Fun-With-Perl subscribers, whereby competitors seek to
         whittle down an executable solution to a challenge to the
         minimum number of (key)strokes. It's not quite obfuscation,
         and it's not quite RSA-in-1-line-of-perl, but it is fun. The
         next round of official Perl Golf at The Perl Review course
         starts on April 1st, but with their handy utilities, you can
         play your own round whenever you want. PGAS is an
         XMLRPC-driven  Perl Golf Administration System, and
         Games::Golf is the Perl golf test suite: with both, even the
         humblest Perl Monastery can devise and manage a few rounds.
         Add in the cultural traditions and rules that the Review did
         finally settle upon (like 'BoB', the pacesetting imaginary
         ubergolfer, who is played by the Judges using the best ideas
         from all current contributions), and you've got the most fun
         you can have while still giving Bertrand Meyer a coronary. Fore!

         black-and-white bafflefest PI (11.40pm, Sat, C4) and, er,

         news" documentaries ALI G: BEFORE HE WAS MASSIV (9.35pm, Wed,

         Foster rape trial THE ACCUSED (10.05pm, Wed, C5)... and still
