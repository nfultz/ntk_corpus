</span><span class="item">         And, after 8 long years, who better than NTK's most brutally 
         affectionate critic LLOYD WOOD to look back at "what the 
         landscape was like" when NTK launched in May 1997. "Slashdot 
         wasn't the force it is now", Lloyd reminisces (in fact, they 
         only showed up the following September), "the blogosphere and 
         its ability to churn crud to the top was nowhere to be seen, 
         there was no Fark getting all the amusing links. There was a 
         sense that something was needed to counteract the American 
         view of things, but we're all Americans now". "And that's 
         why", Lloyd predicts, "NTK is switching to a monthly format". 
         Careful what you wish for, Lloyd - NTK will be going monthly 
         "for essential maintenance" over the summer, though you can 
         still follow our other antics at the various URLs below. And, 
         who knows, maybe even come up with something constructive for 
         this year's BACKSTAGE.BBC.CO.UK OPEN TECH 2005 (proper "Call 
         For Participation" follows), which we're helping to put 
         together along with the UK Unix User Group, aiming for 
         something a bit like last year's "NotCon" and 2002's "Extreme 
         Computing", though with a more coherent theme and better 
         organised. But, you know, in a good way.

         Molineux Stadium, Wolverhampton, UKP5/ UKP3 concessions) looks 
         a little like one of those sports games where they haven't 
         licensed the actual player names, and thus features "Rufas" 
         Pollock (the crime-fighting pseudonym of Foundation for a Free 
         Information Infrastructure's "Rufus" Pollock) and Sarah "Ewan" 
         (a close relative of Linux-on-the-PS2 guru Sarah "Ewen"). Oh 
         and digital-Dr-Who-in-waiting Bill Thompson, "What's up with 
         that?" PC recycler James Wallbank, and co-creator of Elite, 
         Ian Bell (all of whom appear to be spelt correctly). Speaking 
         of Big Mouth Billy Bass Thompson, expect similar high-spirited 
         debate (though slightly less emphasis on webcasting) at the 
         Cambridge-based firebrand's annual GEEK PUNT PICNIC (setting 
         sail around 12.30pm, Sun 2005-06-05, from The Mill public 
         house, Cambridge, punts charged at around UKP2 per hour per 
         person, please RSVP direct to Bill). "We will be heading 
         upriver", maintains Bill, in a perhaps unconscious echo of 
         "Apocalypse Now", though not quite as far as the "heart of 
         darkness" itself, the William H Gates Comp Sci building.

         NTK. For many years, my biggest claim to fame was adding
         Keystone Kops to Nethack. Now, however, I've created a
         Firefox extension that might be worthy of your notice:
         PLATYPUS. It has all the ingredients for instant success: a
         nerdy-but-hip name, a fashionably angry-looking logo, and
         usefulness to only a tiny portion of Internet users. As if
         that weren't enough, it's actually very useful: it allows
         Firefox users to visually edit a web page and then save
         those changes (via the Magic of Greasemonkey (TM)) to be
         applied again the next time the page is viewed. Oh, sure,
         that sounds trivial but then you didn't have to implement it
         in a foul language like Javascript. Check it out, I think
         you'll enjoy it!" And so we will, just after putting this

         alike movies... HOW ART MADE THE WORLD (9.30pm, Mon, BBC2)

         manner on the notion of "the hero's journey"... as ingeniously 
         parodied in Verhoeven/ Schwarzenegger tour-de-force TOTAL 
         RECALL (10.50pm, Mon, BBC1)... Tuesday showcases 23 years of 
         computer graphics "progress" with the all-new CAPTAIN SCARLET 
         (4.30pm, Tue, ITV) up against Disney's 1982 original TRON 
         (1pm, Tue, BBC2)... and two different views of "geek culture" 
         are contrasted in Kieren "The Register" McCarthy's tale of 
         domain-hijacking derring-do THE SEX.COM STORY (11.05pm, Wed,
