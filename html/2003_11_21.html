</span><span class="item">         Remember the good old days, when you and your transhumanist
         mates could amicably disagree on such pressing topics as the
         name of your crypto-currency, the ocean your data haven
         nano-atoll would float on, and whether or not you'd let your
         other post-singularity instantiations join a hive-mind?
         These days, that precious techno-consensus has shattered.
         Brother against brother, Stross against Raymond; people
         don't even agree which Political Compass quiz to take any
         more. We're still trying to map out this new reality (so
         much more tedious than the new realities we thought we'd
         have by now). But an announcement this week seemed to peg
         out the scale a little for us: the techno-libertarian Cato
         Institute arguing with techno-socialist Bill Thompson over
         whether Google should be a public utility. As diverse a
         viewpoint as you could muster, and just as realistic a
         discussion as those "what colour will you dye your solar
         system" chats we had all those years ago. Meanwhile, in an
         attempt to be non-partisan, we've accepted a 1UKP bribe from 
         an anonymous NTK subscriber to "lay off Bill" for a bit - 
         see: interventionism *and* the free market, together at last!

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         First off, apologies to subscribers whose NTK was spam-trapped 
         a couple of weeks ago for inadvertently including a open proxy 
         IP address buried in the Received: header. We've realised how 
         to stop that: we don't have such an easy solution for anyone 
         who works at Channel4, whose corporate gateway blocked last 
         week's issue for being "of a pornographic nature", possibly 
         due to the inclusion of some of the channel's own TV listings. 
         If SAM KINGTON can read this at all, it's probably via our RSS 
         feed, after his SpamSieve installation achieved an superhuman 
         level of Bayesian sentience and rejected NTK 2003-08-08 for 
         its gratuitous use of such giveaways as "organised", "mitnick", 
         "mercy", "preceded", "erotic", "non-" and (apparently) "3210". 
         But even he should consider himself lucky that he doesn't work 
         at HITACHI DATA SYSTEMS, who hinted at their strict definition 
         of work-related mail by remarking "Your message failed to pass 
         Hitachi Data Systems content filtering system", in response to 
         our "Welcome to the NTKnow mailing list" Mailman confirmation 
         greeting.

         To be honest, Tom, we're currently looking to whether the 
         plural of "goto" should in fact be "goes to", just as it 
         should technically be "passers-by", "Whoppers Junior" and 
         "Burgers King".) Anyway, we're sure someone will be able to 
         explain the correct pluralisation to you at next Tuesday's 
         open-to-the-public "introduction to Linux and free software" 
         MENSA LECTURE (7pm, Tue 2003-11-25, Dover Castle pub, London 
         W1G, UKP4.50 inc "1 drink from bar"). It's delivered by NTK 
         reader, Linux Magazine contributor (and Lead Programmer on 
         Gamecube "Die Hard Vendetta"?) STEVEN GOODWIN, with the 
         intriguing title "Why My Friends And I Re-Invented The Wheel.

         converts it into a Macromedia Flash animation - an instant
