         GRAHAM NORTON took this a bit far when he rang up the
         surprised "owner" of a glove fetish page on his TV show this
         week and explained [exact wording]: "We emailed to the
         people who put up your site and they gave me your number" -
         surely violating even GeoCities' standards of data
         protection privacy? Well, not if the guy they spoke to -
         the plausible-sounding "keith@geocities.com" - doesn't
         actually exist. Dedicated porn-surfers here at NTK soon
         found a remarkably similar glove page, differing only in
         background graphic, contact details and lack of pic of Joan
         Collins. The creator of this page denies all knowledge of
         the show, leaving the obvious post-Vanessa speculation: who
         was on the other end of that (admittedly hilarious) phone call?

         Standards Authority adjudication is dated January) but good
         to see the phoney war between AOL and DEMON shows no sign of
         letting up . The ASA upheld AOL's complaint over Demon's
         claims of being "the UK's number one Internet service
         provider" and that "More people get on with us", believing
         consumers would not understand Demon's distinction between
         Online Service Providers and ISPs (well, AOL doesn't seem
         to). Of course, it's all a bit academic now that Freeserve
         has trounced them both, but next time AOL start running
         those "No wonder we're number one" ads (or indeed, bang on

         of us with jobs in the media who've never done a decent
         day's work in their lives. Greater slack should be available
         at Bristol's UK COMIC FESTIVAL (from today 1999-04-02 to Sun
         04-04), this year featuring Garth "Preacher" Ennis, Warren
         "Transmetropolitan" Ellis, an army of ex-2000AD "art
         droids", and a movie All Nighter of comics-based turkeys
         like Judge Dredd and Howard The Duck. And speaking of
         work-shy fops, the ICA is hosting some promo event for those
         zany EMI Songbooks (Sat 1999-04-03, London SW1, UKP22), with
         Robert Crumb, Gilbert Shelton and Ivor Cutler tempting you

</span><span class="item">         Yes, yes, yes - but *which* PALMPILOT? The chunky IIIx with
         hackable expansion port, an acceptable 4MB of RAM, the
         original sync socket (so you can use all your old
         peripherals) and a plastic case around which you can still
         mess with a Phillips screwdriver? Or the Palm V, with
         its sleek, finger-thin exterior, "executive styling", a
         backwards-incompatible sync socket, hermetically-sealed
         chassis with imprisoned rechargeable batteries you can only
         replenish by dragging the cradle around with you, and a
         humiliatingly unexpandable 2MB? Case closed? Not quite. This
         month, Japanese hacker Toshio Kashiwagi discovered that you
         could dismantle the sealed V unit by using a hairdryer to
         melt the sealant. An 8MB RAM chip could then be soldered
         onto the board, and the two halves jammed together with
         superglue to make fractionally fatter, but infinitely cooler
         uber-five. Hours of warranty-invalidating fun that
         pisses on any machismo hackery those IIIx guys could ever
         contrive. Management types keen to fake geek credibility
         can pay the guys at the euphemistically-named Electronic
         Fast Integration Group $150 to do it for them, or $600 to
         buy a pre-bloated V. At your own risk, natch.

         a Woody - Harrelson, that is... uber-slacker drama REALITY
         BITES (10.15pm, Fri, BBC2) could not be more early '90s if
         it cast Winona Ryder, Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, and
         Ethan Hawke - wait a minute, it does... all followed by
         100th episode SEINFELD clip show (11.45pm, Fri, BBC2)...
         "Cheggers" Chegwin runs down the TOP TEN NOVELTY ONE-HIT
         WONDERS (9.30pm, Sat, C4), in a format that surely spells
         doom for John Peel yawnathons like "Rock Family Trees"...
         Lee &amp; Herring are pulled off for Easter, leaving a choice of
         new messiahs: Harrison Ford in BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUT

         shown with Ringo Lam's inspirational CITY ON FIRE (12.40am,
         Sun, C4) plus Brit knock-off FACE (10pm, Mon, BBC2)... or
         Oliver Stone's JFK (10pm, Sun, BBC2) - followed by an Outer

         it)... Pam "Mindy" Dawber TV satire STAY TUNED (2.35pm, Mon,
         ITV) had the worst video-sleeve tagline in human history:
         "Most people would love to get into television. Helen and
         Roy have 24 hours to get out of it - literally!"... but when
         UFO tosh ROSWELL (9pm, Mon, C4) opens with Kyle MacLachlan
         and pals badly made up as old men, it (phew) means that the
         rest of the film is in flashback, rather than - say - being
         about a bunch of guys badly made up as old men... sod

         self-explanatory LIE DETECTOR (5pm &amp; lunchtimes, Tue, ITV)
         finds a brand new way of libelling members of the public...

         Weston movingly updates us on his progress in SIMON's
         JOURNEY (9.30pm, Thu, BBC1) - not to be confused with the

         isn't "a medieval Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels" (Nick
         Fisher, The Sun) - for the simple reason that P&amp;M is set in
         1748, and the medieval era is widely considered to have
         ended about 300 years earlier... yeah, OK, we meant no
         *acting* Oscars for last week's Gods And Monsters -
         especially not for Brendan Fraser, who extends his Encino
         Man/ George Of The Jungle shtick to the same innocent abroad
         in BLAST FROM THE PAST (MPAA: Rated PG-13 for brief
         language, sex and drug references). Unlike, say, "Back To
         The Future" (on now!, Fri, BBC1), these new '50s films - The
         Truman Show, Pleasantville - never seem to realise that the
         timeshift could be just an amusing detail rather than a
         massive excuse for a plot... just what the world was
         waiting for - *another* quirky look at life in an Italian
         fascist death camp, this time with - wait for it! - Judi

         consumer-mag compulsory "What Our Ratings Mean" table for any
         readers confused by their switch from A-E to 1 to 5 stars...
         scourge of Usenet-naming (and Britain's best games
         journalist) STUART CAMPBELL makes ARCADE almost worth
         UKP2.70, with his top 50 "Top Players" in the games biz
         including some surprise entries (Digitiser's Paul Rose at 12)
         and an amusing icon system borrowed - if we're not mistaken -
         from the "Night Of 100 Serial Killers" in ANSWER ME... we
         also detect Campbell's fingerprints on the "Emulation
         Rarities" piece in April's EDGE, which continues to redeem
         itself with a John Carmack interview on subdivision surfaces
         vs NURBS. Still confused about the difference between
         "palpable" and "palatable", though (p79) - and surely it was

         Rapide are not "going away", and fully expect to "trade out"
