</span><span class="item">         NETSCAPE inched back ahead of MICROSOFT this week by
         releasing a beta of NETCASTER - software that lets Netscape
         users subscribe to (stop me if you've heard this) "channels
         of information that appear on your desktop". Similar push
         media support is due in the final version of Microsoft's
         Internet Explorer 4.0 - but that's not out yet. Netscape's
         standard for creating the new channels is also closer to
         standard HTML programming than Microsoft's planned CDF
         format. Hoorah for the plucky underdog of a $3 billion
         software company!

</span><span class="item">         The BBC announced THE BEEB, an online consumer service

         consist of a set of branded sites (like <a href="http://www.topgear.com">www.topgear.com</a>),
         with an Internet access package a possibility later in the
         year (like when people work out how to make money out of
         it). The service is funded by ICL, rather than the license
         fee. Software will be available for the BBC Model 'B' only.
         That's our little joke.

         pro-Newton in a MacAddict interview, published just as Jobs
         was announcing he wanted to flog the PDA off. Only thing
         they got right, says Woz; "I don't want the little scribble

         storm: PHIL ZIMMERMANN confessed to having helped South
         American freedom fighters use his Pretty Good Privacy
         program, a criminal act under US law. Cambridge
         University's dour ROSS ANDERSON efficiently shot holes in
         the Department of Trade and Industry's proposed Trusted
         Third Parties system: these trusted parties are likely to
          be banks and telecom companies, both of which have *awful*
         records in admitting security breaches (phantom
         withdrawals? 'Beige box' hacking of residential phone
         lines, anyone?). And WHIT DIFFIE, General-Custer-resembling
         inventor of public-key cryptography, said why he thought
         the legislation was *unnecessary* as well as dangerous.

</span><span class="item">         TV HIGHLIGHTS: C4 pitches up its zany SITCOM WEEKEND (from
         7pm, Sat, C4), with wry tributes and repeats of various
         imported curiosities... BBC2 hits back with KUNG FU NIGHT
         (9.10pm, Sat, BBC2), including spectacular Bruce Lee
         showcaser ENTER THE DRAGON (10pm, Sat, BBC2)... the Bank
         Holiday HERE AND NOW (7.30pm, Mon, BBC1) is an
          investigative special into - wait for it - The Spice
         Girls... C5 persists in showing an important collective
         work appallingly out of sequence with REVENGE OF THE NERDS
         IV: NERDS IN LOVE (9pm, Mon, C5)... out of nowhere comes a
         repeat of season two of THE X-FILES (10.50pm, Tue and
         10.25pm, Wed, BBC1)... and a new series of REPUTATIONS
         (9pm, Wed, BBC2) sharpens its hatchet on philosophy poster-
         boy Bertrand Russell - apparently "the logic and reason of
         his public life were in sharp contrast to a private world
         of passion, jealousy and marital disaster"...

</span><span class="item">         MOVIES: BEAVIS AND BUTTHEAD DO AMERICA (snickering cartoon
         caricatures) is exactly what you'd expect: no music videos,
         but plenty of single-entendres and exposed American
         underbelly... SPACE TRUCKERS (Dennis Hopper, Stephen Dorff)
         appears to be a mix between Red Dwarf and Aliens - we're
         not sure that's a recommendation... and low-rent romantic
         comedy is the order of the day in LOVE AND OTHER
         CATASTROPHES (no-one you've heard of), like an Australian
         Brothers McMullen/sort of whimsical movie-buffs' Friends...

</span><span class="item">         MAGAZINES: Two newies due this month: REVOLUT!ON is the Noo
         Medja magazine from those nice CAMPAIGN people: one for the
         *snappily-dressed* suits, we think. For the plebs, CONNECT
         is from Future publishing, and will be a bunch of URLs with
         some lifestyle articles wrapped around it. We wish them
         success: more success, perhaps, than COMPUTER LIFE, whose
         oxymoronic demise is rumoured in ZIFF-DAVIS despatches.
