</span><span class="item">         Wasn't it Brian Wilson who said "Heheheheheheee WIPO
         oooout!"? Him or one of the Fat Boys. Anyway: not much surf
         but a lot of turf-wars on the shores of Lake Geneva this
         week, with yet another shortcut being taken by the Evil
         Intellectual Property Developers at the World IP
         Organisation's copyright committee. Here's the scene: the
         IPers want to create a bundle of new IP rights: not for
         creative artists, but for those who package and broadcast
         their works on air or online. The idea is that a broadcaster
         can record a public domain or Creative Commons licensed
         work, claim "FIXATION RIGHTS" to it, and retain control of
         that expression for the next twenty years. Did I say twenty?
         I'm sorry - that's what they used to want. Now it's *fifty*
         years, to match Sonny Bono inflation in copyright
         extensions. WIPO thought this was a done deal (after all,
         who could complain about more rights?) - until a few of the
         developing countries and those pesky open source advocates
         started taking note. Developing countries: not so keen on
         yet another round of having their native cultures air-lifted
         out of their control. OSS folk: not thrilled about a WIP
         definition of "broadcasting" that could include docs, files,
         or executables. Could you take a GPL'd program, "broadcast"
         it on the Net, and then claim exclusive copyright control on
         that expression? No-one at WIPO knew. The end result: not
         for the first or last time, the developing world teamed up
         with the free software folk to backburn the proposal. Well,
         all except Kenya, who went on about how they'd passed a law
         banning people from taking photos of TV broadcasts to prove
         what a good IP world citizen they were. Better to back the
         Bitching Boys than the Fat Cats on this particular track,
         we think...

</span><span class="item">         NTK subscriber JASON KITCAT has been hacking away on
         electronic voting systems long before they became
         unfashionable. And by "hack" here, we mean, mostly, the
         exact opposite: carefully investigating a secure, reliable,
         open source system that might actually work, rather than the 
         hodge-podge of bad security and whizz-nag touchscreens that 
         dominate the commercial offerings. These days, as the rush
         to introduce voting machines overtakes the slow pace of
         getting them right, Jason's joined with cyberrights groups
         across Europe to try and at least slow down the acceptance
         of these sub-standard Diebold-style cheat-o-matics. Right
         now, the EU's position has been (to use the rhetorical form
         pioneered by Kitcat's choccie namesake) "you can't verify
         your vote, you can't authenticate your privacy, you look
         awful - you'll go a long way". Kitcat's resolution to 
         encourage voter-verifiable audit trails in European voting 
         machines might help stop that. You can sign it at the URL 
         below, and follow in the illustrious footsteps of MPs, 
         ukcrypto wonks and some bearded Free Software guy whose name
         escapes us.

         didn't even fall back on our old "heap big webserver pow-wow" 
         gag that has marred our coverage of this event in the past. In 
         other linguistic mixups, reader RONAN WAIDE bounced back from 
         our misquoting of his Japanese t-shirt "translation" (he was 
         merely passing on Babelfish's "shiru hitsuyousei" suggestion, 
         while the shirt actually says "shirubeki koto" - almost as 
         good as "shiru hitsuyou", according to BENJAMIN PETERSON), and 
         will be delivering a free public presentation at the end of 
         this month on RSS - REALLY SIMPLE SYNDICATION (Tue 2003-11-25, 
         Residents Lounge, Earl of Kildare Hotel, Dublin 2), and 
         hopefully taking the opportunity to clarify whether "RSS"

         on earth, but Marc Fest's QUICKBROWSE and ONLINEHOMEBASE
         have a wiki-ish simplicity that makes them easy to set up,
         hand out to friends, and use as inspiration for your own
         projects. Also, they're easy to explain. Quickbrowse takes 
         a list of URLs and jams them together onto one page (more
         convienient than you'd think, especially if the
         quick-loading aggregrate is emailed to your HTML browser).
         Onlinehomebase is just a giant permanent store of textareas:
         a Web-based notebook into which you can also drop time-based
         messages that trigger mail reminders. Bookmarklets and crypto, 
         file uploading and email gateway; it's worthing messing around

         AND AWE: THE RETURN OF ALIEN, WITH DANNY BOYLE (12.40am, Fri, 
         C5) shows probably as many old clips as those A VS P promos: 
         <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/avp/">http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/avp/</a> ... THE BIG READ: THE 
         HITCH-HIKER'S GUIDE TO THE GALAXY (9.30pm, Sat, BBC2) attempts 
         to overcome the fact that it's a novelisation of a radio 
         series and, in common with much of Adams' work, doesn't have 
         any particular ending... while Hugh Grant Day climaxes with 
         BRITS GO TO HOLLYWOOD (9pm, Sat, C4), this year's showing of 
         FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL (10pm, Sat, C4) plus Woody Allen 
         caper comedy SMALL TIME CROOKS (12.10am, Sat, C4) - now 
         showing in C4's prestigious post-midnight premiere slot, along 
         with suburban child-molest-fest HAPPINESS (12.20am, Mon, C4), 
         crack dealing miniseries THE CORNER (1.10am, Tue, C4), and 
         Charlize Theron's alien impregnation THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE 
         (11.15pm, Wed, C4)... grand unified pop-physics stab THE 
         THEORY OF EVERYTHING (8pm, Sun, C4) is presented by a bloke 
         impersonating Commander Data ... MOVIE MISTAKES (8.30pm, Sun, 
         C5) discovers there's nothing less funny than actually seeing 
         movie goofs in action... then PANORAMA SPECIAL (9pm, Sun, 
         BBC1) celebrates 50 years of the current affairs slot with the 
         time the US military tried to kill John Simpson... the wacky 
         world of prostitution is gently ridiculed by LOUIS [THEROUX] 
         AND THE BROTHEL (9pm, Sun, BBC2), though weirdly you never see 
         him applying his ingenue-style interview technique to subjects 
         like WITNESS: INSIDE THE MIND OF THE SUICIDE BOMBER (9pm, Mon, 
         C4)... there's a topical showing for politically puzzling 
         Marines-shooting-unarmed-Yemenis courtroom yell-off RULES OF 
         ENGAGEMENT (9pm, Tue, ITV) ... and Helen Mirren takes on her 
         slipperiest opponent yet - Slobodan Milosevic - in the last 
         ever PRIME SUSPECT (9pm, Sun, ITV)... HOW CLEAN IS YOUR HOUSE 
         (8.30pm, Wed, C4) is basically "Grime Scene Investigation":

         "Big Brother nerd" Jon Tickle will hopefully examine why the 
         public always vote for reality-show contestants who clearly 
         have no future in entertainment television on his new show 
         BRAINIAC: SCIENCE ABUSE (8pm, Thu, Sky1)... but nothing in 
         Paul Verhoeven's appalling invisibility yawn HOLLOW MAN 
         (10.10pm, Thu, C5) is as scary as the "broken milk carton" in 
         pre-Airplane nuke spoof THE BIG BUS (12.25am, Thu, BBC1)...
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; obviously it would be controversial to claim it's our 
         favourite of the trilogy (largely 'cos the first is so wildly 
         overrated), but once Neo goes all "Dune Messiah", there's a 
         decent "future war" movie at the end of MATRIX REVOLUTIONS 
         ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/matrixrevolutions.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/matrixrevolutions.htm</a> : 
         mockery of God, Jesus, Satan and the antiChrist; men showing 
         intimate affection to each other; extensive revelry)... else 
         there's the prospect of tiny-headed Christina Ricci, John 
         "mobile ads" Simm, plus Kyle "Dune Guy" MacLachlan - together 
         at last! - in dominatrix/ con-woman dom-con rom-com MIRANDA

         nudity - lots of heavy breathing, short skirts and humping

         or the error-riddled depressingly-uplifting depression-era 
         loosely-based-on-true-story horse-racing travesty SEABISCUIT

         repeatedly referred to as being 18 hands vs. Seabiscuit's 15

         BONERS: CORRECTIONS, CLARIFICATIONS, AND "INCORRECTLY REGARDED 
</span><span class="geekmedia">         AS GOOFS"&gt;&gt; and a special no-prize to everyone who wrote to 
         let us know that the "fresh dolphin" which IBM customers just 
         love to consume <a href="http://www.ntk.net/2003/09/12/dohdolph.gif">http://www.ntk.net/2003/09/12/dohdolph.gif</a> "is 
         actually talking about the Dolphinfish or Mai Mai", rather 
         than the popular seagoing mammal, noted first poster ANDREW 
         MOBBS. THE REVEREND JOE MCNALLY kind of spoiled an earlier 
         joke <a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-09-12&amp;l=154#l">http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-09-12&amp;l=154#l</a> by 
         explaining that "Splittist is the Chinese govt's peculiar word 
         for anyone who favours booting the Chinese out of Tibet" (he 
         ran into it "with numbing regularity" in the Chinese Embassy's 
         press releases in the early 1990s, whose other remarkable 
         quality was that "they appeared to be printed on that coarse 
         green paper more normally used in the manufacture of the hand 
         towels you get in pub toilets"), while DOM ROBINSON confirmed 
         that C4 did swap the order of the last 2 episodes of "Peep 
         Show" (one of the "comedy highlights" of his year), at least 
         compared to their transmission on E4, presumably because the 
         penultimate one made a stronger close to the series without 
         (badly) compromising the character arc... IAIN CUNNINGHAM was 
         the only one to "incorrectly regard us as goofs" over last 
         month's doh description "Italy invests in enough power to run 
         60W lightbulb" <a href="http://www.ntk.net/2003/10/03/dohmilli.gif">http://www.ntk.net/2003/10/03/dohmilli.gif</a> , 
         arguing "12,000mW is 12W and therefore not enough to run a 60W 
         bulb (unless of course you just want to use it to gently warm 
         your hands on - but doing that will vitrify the envelope and 
         so shorten the bulb life)" - the correct calculation from the 
         image is left as an exercise for the reader - but ASH provoked 
         our greatest wrath for daring to suggest we were using a 
         "greengrocer's apostrophe" in our weekly heading "goto's 
         considered non-harmful". As Ash soon found out, apostrophes 
         are in fact used like this to form "an alternative spelling, 
         for clarity, of the plurals of a very few short words": 
         <a href="http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/pizza">http://www.askoxford.com/asktheexperts/faq/aboutspelling/pizza</a> 
         - when we replied "OK, if you're so clever, you tell us: 
         should it be 'gotos' or 'gotoes'?", Ash responded "Oooh that's 
         the old potatoes/potatos question", which wasn't quite the 
         level of plural-forming expertise we'd previously hoped for...
