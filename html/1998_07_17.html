</span><span class="item">         Mac users celebrated APPLE's increasing ability to suck
         money off them this week, as the company revealed profits of
         62UKP million for the last quarter. Gross margins were up,
         thanks to the elimination of all those unnecessary
         clone-makers, and inventory problems eliminated by 
         selling just three ingeniously demarcated product lines: the G3
         laptop, the G3 server, or the G3 desktop. But the "any model
         I want, as long as it's Mac" brigade haven't got *just*
         themselves to thank for the company's return to healthy,
         quasi-monopolist form. As vital on the balance sheet was
         British Acorn remnants ARM, whose IPO earlier this year
         handed co-founders Apple a cool 20UKP million. All those
         Archimedes owners will be *so* pleased.

         the innocence of a virginal relationship and allow everyone
         on the Net to watch them as they attempt to screw one
         another for the first time. Yes, REAL NETWORKS and their
         minority shareholders MICROSOFT, ostensibly partners but
         frankly gagging for a punch-up, finally let the fists fly
         with Real's official beta release of G2, their new
         RealAudio, RealVideo, RealPix, RealKitchenSink streaming
         system. As from now, Microsoft's currently piss-poor Netshow
         will not be compatible with streamed Real content. Nor will
         Microsoft support SMIL, the newly proclaimed standard for
         synchronising these kinds of multimedia hijinx. They say
         that's because it's "unnecessary". Unnecessarily compatible
         with G2 - which does support it.

         GILMORE to prove the point. With 250,000UKP and a nifty
         piece of dedicated parallel hardware, he snapped the back of
         the latest code-cracking DES challenge in an embarrassing
         two and half days - hardly time for his chief rivals,
         distributed.net, to get their latest key-crunching client
         out the door to their thousands of volunteers.

         to up the Netscape Website hits by redirecting keyword
         searches to the site, and a new "find related links"
         feature. First reactions are that these capabilities are
         intrinsically evil; closer inspection shows some neat
         configuration possibilities (so you can pick your own related
         site server - even tie it into Altavista). IMAP's noticeably
         better, and the mail client looks a bit less
         slapped-together, but the really cool extras to let you
         remotely access your bookmarks, address book and calendar
         are yet to come. We'd say wait. For about two days, then

         impressive-at-the-time 1989 Archimedes original, ZARCH is a
         sort of cross between Lander and a 3d version of Defender.
         Almost exactly as you remember it - and twice as
         disappointing - this was one of the only reasons the
         nation's school computers ever got used.  We're still
         waiting for XFrak though...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; we're pleased to announce that sports coverage has been
         suspended due to over-running of quirky B-movies: John
         Hughes auditions Macaulay Culkin in similar, superior Home
         Alone prequel UNCLE BUCK (8pm, Fri, BBC1)...  Robert Powell
         traps the inspiration for Ghostbusters' Slimer in
         paranormally good '70s Brit-schlock, THE ASPHYX (12.55am,
         Fri, BBC1)...  Jonathan Ross lays waste to "so bad they're
         good" myth with hideous overdose of GODZILLA DAY (11am-10pm,
         Sat, Sky Movies Gold)... and the line "Objection, your
         honouAAAARRRGGHH!!" does not appear in THE TRIAL OF THE
         INCREDIBLE HULK (3.15pm, Sat, some ITV), though it does have
         visually-challenged superhero Daredevil and "Slider" John
         Rhys-Davies...  Neil Morrissey inexplicably returns in a
         whole bloody series of THE VANISHING MAN (7.45pm, Sat, ITV),
         just after Carrey vs Cox in the always-remarkable ACE
         VENTURA: PET DETECTIVE (6.15pm, Sat, ITV)... yup, MIAMI
         RHAPSODY (9pm, Sat, C4) is a bit like Woody Allen lite - or
         a very good sitcom episode... and Frank Black strives to
         find anyone who cares about a new run of MILLENNIUM
         (10.30pm, Sat, ITV)... a season of Stephen King's famously
         unfilmable fables starts with DOLORES CLAIBORNE (10pm, Sun,
         C4)... though more nudity, less coherence in TWIN PEAKS:
         FIRE WALK WITH ME (11.45pm, Sun, BBC2)... sadly, it doesn't
         seem to be former page 3 model Gail McKenna among Terry
         Nutkins' BRILLIANT CREATURES (4.50pm, Mon, ITV)...  but it
         is oafish Bob Mills hosting new trivia panel game NOT A LOT
         OF PEOPLE KNOW THAT (11pm, Mon, BBC1)... not just another
         example of the BBC ripping off American titles for their own
         shows - WEIRD SCIENCE (12.05am, Mon, BBC1) is genuinely a
         spin-off from the 1985 John Hughes movie... Mad About You
         retread LOVED BY YOU (8.30pm, Tue, ITV) returns with a VR
         episode... Stephen Jay Gould believes Stephen King's THE
         TOMMYKNOCKERS (10pm, Tue, C4) to be the best evolutionary
         allegory ever... Clarkson and co battle a nightmarish Mad
         Max flooded-Earth future in TOP GEAR WATERWORLD (8.30pm,
         Thu, BBC2)... and let's raise a glass to unsubtle product
         placement in three-part carbonated retrospective THE
         COCA-COLA CONQUEST (11.55pm, Thu, C4), "tracing the history
         of the soft drink, and its lifelong competition with rival
         Pepsi" (The Radio Times)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; au contraire, GODZILLA (imdb: action / sci-fi /
         godzilla / giant-monster) appears to be entirely in the
         spirit of the originals, in that it's largely rubbish. But
         c'mon, who really expects monster movies to make sense
         now?... sub-aqua kiddie fun resurfaces after 9 years in the
         form of THE LITTLE MERMAID (imdb: animation / children's /
         musical / romance / sea / underwater / little-mermaid /
         ocean / family / disney-animated-feature / comedy) - but of
         course the search term you're looking for is really +"little
         mermaid" +"obvious penis"... and to commemorate the launch
         of MicroSoft's sinister purple robot child-minder ("Clean
         Up! Clean Up! Everybody do their share!"), sing along with
         BARNEY'S GREAT ADVENTURE (imdb: children's / family /
         dinosaur) - though, despite the implicit suggestion of the
         title, the film does *not* depict Barney's first sexual
         experience...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         PRO-CELEBRITY FEEBDACK&gt;&gt; thanks to all who wrote in with
         eye-witness sightings and tastings of Callipo Shots and
         Winner Tacos [NTK 03/07/98], especially Connected columnist
         MICHAEL BYWATER for his mouth-watering depiction of the
         "magnificently chundrous" Winner Taco - "the heavy
         insulating wafer clamshell protecting the tradition Walls'
         pigfat-style icecream from unsightly heat-exchange
         phase-shift, sealed at its lip with thick and somehow
         unconvincing chocolate". Michael generously describes NTK as
         "the best-written publication in Britain" - coming from the
         man who invented Starship Titanic's "Pulsating Inconvenience
         from the Planet Sprod", high praise indeed!... sticking with
         self-indulgence, tubby cyber-subscriber BRUCE STERLING
         queried our gag that his 'Triple Xtra Large' feature in the
         new Wired "strangely omits himself": "The heck you say; my
         Triple Xtra Large self is not only on the cover, it's inside
         a little monorail... it's even packing on the pounds in Le
         Jules Verne... You should get up from the keyboard and eat
         something." Cheers for the tip Bruce, but we're comfy eating
         where we are... this reader's URL
         <a href="http://ourworld.darq.net/p.hampton-forbes/">http://ourworld.darq.net/p.hampton-forbes/</a> revived fears
         that NTK "may be attracting the wrong element"... and
         "Funny. Very funny. Hilarious." writes bedroom techno
         boffin, Q Magazine demo compo winner, and former Doom
         champion, DAVID MCCANDLESS, no doubt referring to the fact
         that instead of giving "a plug" to his site
         <a href="http://www.wakeywakey.com">http://www.wakeywakey.com</a>, we inadvertently registered the
         address <a href="http://i.am/a.gaylord">http://i.am/a.gaylord</a>, pointed it at his page, then
         printed that URL instead [NTK 10/07/98]. NTK regrets the
         error...
