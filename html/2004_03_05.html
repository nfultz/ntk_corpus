</span><span class="item_space"> 
</span><span class="item">         Who can be bothered to keep up with the SCO story these
         days? Only those who like a laugh. To summarise for those of
         you with better things to do: SCO first announced that they
         had a paying "licensee" for "Linux", worth "seven digits".
         The licensee, EV1servers said they'd paid - not that much.
         Paypal error in your favour, SCO! Next, always a little
         publicity-shy, SCO sent out a press release announcing that
         they'd be sending out another press release, announcing a
         Linux user they'd be suing. Tomorrow. No, no, the next day.
         Two users. Yes, two. The day after tomorrow duly arrived
         (along with their financials, which sucked). SCO said they'd
         be suing AutoZone. Not, as it turns out, for using "their"
         Linux without a license: but for migrating their servers
         from SCO to Linux "too quickly" for them not to be illegally
         using SCO's own libraries. SCO's case was water-tight, and
         entirely unexpected, with only one flaw: the person in
         charge of migration had posted to the GrokLaw site nearly a
         *month* ago, asserting that they'd not had to use any SCO
         libraries, and that he'd be happy to explain exactly "why
         SCO lost AutoZone's and several large account's businesses"
         in public. SCO also sued DaimlerChrysler, an act one
         eye-witness said caused widespread ROTFLMAO at the company.
         Then someone leaked ESR an internal SCO mail implying that
         Microsoft was funding the whole thing. Suavely, SCO admitted
         that mail was genuine. Then, as if admitting to your leaked
         documents wasn't bad enough for preserving secrecy, someone
         at ZDNET - ZDNET! - did "show changes" on one of their Word
         documents, and found several versions of their barratry
         strategies. With a grudging nod to ESR, it looks there's a
         parallel Gandhicon going on here: first they're worried
         you'll win; then they fight you; then they start laughing.
         Soon, comes the ignoring. And then you're gone.

</span><span class="item">         Just a quick update on last month's story about EBAY.CO.UK 
         filling up with pyramid-like "Matrix" scams - eBay's official 
         position (attributed to "an eBay spokesperson") admits: "It is 
         important to note that these items are not permitted on 
         eBay.co.uk and any of these items that come to our attention 
         will be removed. It is against eBay's policy for any user to 
         purchase items outside of the site or for catalogues to be 
         listed where users can directly order items". The operative 
         phrase here being "any of these items that come to our 
         attention" - eBay appears to have no interest in filtering 
         these auctions out itself, preferring that users do it via 
         their mildly convoluted maximum-10-items-per-submission 
         complaints form. This appears to be what they're trying to do 
         over at sites like MATRIXWATCH.ORG - but given that eBay.co.uk 
         does appear to remove auctions for illegal electric stun guns 
         and other weapons from their site, wouldn't it be easier if 
         they also added some of these to their list?

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         And just to draw a line under our most recent craze: the .name 
         registration gold rush has petered out at last, with CHRIS 
         BARNES claiming he's now "the proud owner of" my.domain.name, 
         SCHABE wondering "if there's a prize for most hostile entry" 
         re: his bitch.say-my.name, and ERIC PALMQUIST getting more 
         phonetic with his thatzma.name suggestion. But "don't read NTK 
         drunk" was the concluding moral offered by DARREN IRVINE, that 
         condition having contributed to his wanton registering of 
         theman.withno.name. Excellent safety tip Darren, though 
         sometimes it takes us a while to sober up after writing it.

         romanticising the three housewarming parties he's played in

         nice to use mixing software that brought back the joy of vinyl 
         without spending half a grand on Final Scratch. I've had my 
         eye on the HERCULES DJ CONSOLE but until payday I've got 
         TACTILE 12000 (Windows and OSX), possibly the only 
         Sourceforge project written in Macromedia Director. None of 
         that fancy auto-BPM-detection here; instead you get big 
         spinning discs, draggable needles, nudge buttons, splittable-
         stereo cueing (along with multiple sound outputs) and hotkeys 
         for everything. Admittedly the scratching's a bit crap and the 
         whole thing's rather more Fisher-Price than Fischerspooner, 
         but it's good enough to get me started on my efforts to mix

         much to catch up on in "From The Makers Of Freaks And Geeks" 
         half-hour college comedy UNDECLARED (1am, Fri, ITV)... the 
         trailers give the impression that new Northern Irish sitcom 
         PULLING MOVES (9pm, Fri, BBC3) is like "Lock, Stock and Two
         Smoking Barrels" starring the members of Westlife... and look 
         out for some special new non-aspirational adverts in the 
         breaks to baldy Alain de Botton's latest made-up modern 
         malaise, STATUS ANXIETY (7pm, Sat, C4)... David Fincher's 
         relatively downbeat THE GAME (10pm, Sat, C4) is, depressingly, 
         now cited as an influence in yet another tedious "immersive" 
         time-waster: <a href="http://www.projectsyzygy.com/syzpage2.htm">http://www.projectsyzygy.com/syzpage2.htm</a> ... an

         Sat, C4)... while the lack of humility displayed by Jeff 
         Goldblum in the face of CGI animal romp CATS AND DOGS (6.25pm, 
         Sun, C5) here is staggering... rich kids Dawson's Creek THE 
         ORANGE COUNTY (6.30pm, Sun, C4) doesn't seem very closely 
         based on the Kim Stanley Robinson trilogy of the same name... 
         SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (9pm, Sun, C5) shows in the same slot as 
         "Starship Troopers" last week, though this time the ones in 
         Nazi uniforms are the bad guys!... and DEMOLITION SQUAD 
         (7.30pm, Mon, C5) provides a handy counterpoint to RACE FOR 
         THE WORLD'S TALLEST SKYSCRAPER (8pm, Mon, C5)... film of the 
         week - if not the year - is low-budget "The Making of Co-ven" 
         indie horror AMERICAN MOVIE (12.20am, Tue, BBC2)... hope those 
         BBC iCan windfarm protestors are tuning into powercut scenario 
         IF - THE LIGHTS GO OUT (9pm, Wed, BBC2)... and our main 
         contribution to the "Crisps" episode of THE MONEY PROGRAMME - 
         FAT PROFITS (7.30pm, Wed, BBC2) was suggesting they should

</span><span class="geekmedia">         AD MUSIC FOR SIX PEOPLE&gt;&gt; fortunately you seem to be getting 
         almost as bored about Ad Music That Sounds Like A Well-Known 
         Record as we are, with just one nomination this month for 
         "McDonald's 99p menu" resembling "a third-rate knock-off" of 
         Daft Punk's "Around The World" (plus it's hard to establish 
         whether it actually is a cover of Kylie's "Slow" in the Nivea 
         Moisturiser for Men ad, or just some bleeping noises that 
         sounds a bit like it). In fact, the only thing that'd make 
         this feature more obscure would be picking ads that most of us 
         were never likely to see, an avenue currently pursued by 
         reader ADRIAN FURBY, who maintains a solitary vigil monitoring 
         antipodean television for all manner of transgressions, and 
         dispatching occasional bulletins along the lines of "There's 
         an ad for Libra tampons here in Australia that features three 
         guys, each in a different coloured outfit, breakdancing on a 
         large piece of cardboard to a song that sounds suspiciously 
         like Herbie Hancock's 'Rock It', BUT ISN'T". Tampons for men? 
         What *is* going on down there?... fortunately, January's 
         challenge to find songs which would be ideal for particular
         product campaigns has risen to fill the gap, with even BBC 
         London's Danny Baker suggesting that The Wurzels' cover of 
         Gina G's "Oooh Ahhh, Just a Little Bit" would be perfect for 
         Ribena's new "cool" and "fiery" variants of the same name: 
         <a href="http://www.snackspot.org/thread.php?story=0403031412daa">http://www.snackspot.org/thread.php?story=0403031412daa</a> . TIM 
         BANNISTER proposed that "If for some reason Busted turn down 
         that planned alteration" ("That's What I Go To Poole For", NTK 
         2004-01-16), "there's always a chance that Peaches would be up 
         for a reworded '[Flip] The Pain Away'", concluding with the 
         refrain "Stay in Poole - 'cos it's the best" (we've since 
         moved on to tweaking Coldplay's breakthrough hit to be more 
         about Lucozade - "We've made a drink/ We've made a drink for 
         you/ It's full of energy too/ And it is all: yellow!", and The 
         Shamen's "Destination Eschaton" as an excellent jingle for 
         "Destination: Chessington")... ED SINGLETON has "long thought" 
         "a successful contact lens advert campaign could be built on 
         the back of Mel and Kim's 'Ain't Ever Gonna Be Bespectacled'" 
         (an improvement on our cancer-awareness rework of Kim's solo 
         hit "G.L.A.D - Get Leukaemia And Die"), while reader GRAHAM 
         suggested "Bernard Matthews Turkeys update their image with 
         that Christina Aguilera song, or better yet get Bernard out of 
         retirement to do his own cover version [Bee-yoo-ti-ful/ No 
         matter what they say]". But PAUL DIXON snatched this month's 
         no-prize for a staggering selection of somewhat varying 
         quality, ranging from Kelis' "My Nesquik brings all the boys 
         to the yard" to the Beastie Boys' "You gotta fight! For your 
         right! To Smarrrrrties!" and Oasis' "Wagonwheel": "Maybeeeee, 
         the school bell is gonna save meeeee/ 'Cos playtime makes me 
         feeeeel/ Like a Wagonwheeeeel"...
