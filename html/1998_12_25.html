         Day? What are YOU doing online on Christmas Day? What's
         that? You're reading this in mid-January? Yeah? Then how
         are we having this little conversation then? A series
         of rhetorical questions, you say? Ah. I see. 
         
         Anyway, here follows the usual piebald motley harlequinade
         that is MiniNTK. Strict traditionalists should press delete
         and wait for the next scheduled NTK, which should be on
         8/1/99. People who like to click on the blue words should
         page down, because URLs settled in transit this issue.

         PS MiniNTK are always longer than normal NTKs. The reason
         for this is lost forever in the endless sands of time.]

         like the Prince's Trust, The Royal Marsden Hospitable
         Children's Cancer Unit, Great Ormond Street - oh, and ELSPA,
         the anti-piracy organisation. In fact, 100,000UKP of INDIN
         money (or rather, the money entrusted by its donors) has
         been hallmarked by the committee to go to ELSPA this year -
         almost 10% of the total, and more than any other charity
         with the exception of the Prince's Trust. Sure, charity

         original, less scary BABE (7pm, Fri, BBC1), or the original,
         less scary THE FLY (12.40am, Fri, C4)... astound relatives
         with your unveiling of the gay subtext to CASABLANCA
         (3.10pm, Fri, BBC2) or, should you prefer an easier target,
         Joe Orton bio PRICK UP YOUR EARS (12.45am, Fri, BBC2)...
         plus a loathsome, frond-faced "child" enthralls adults to
         carry out his evil bidding - but enough about the new Alan
         Davies comedy, 'cos THE OMEN is clearly visible over "on the
         other side" (10.35pm, Fri, C4)... the films are even better
         on Boxing Day, with feature-length SUPER MARIO BROS
         (11.45am, Sat, BBC1) bravely incorporating genuine power-up
         mythos... Max Headroom completists will spot Matt Frewer in
         Rick Moranis career-killer HONEY I SHRUNK THE KIDS (3.05pm,
         Sun, ITV)... CASPER (2.50pm, Sat, BBC1) is terrible, but THE
         NAKED GUN 2 1/2 (11.05pm, Sat, BBC1) is better than the
         third one, just not as good as the first... and in A VIEW TO

         skills at bringing in flamboyant, deranged criminal
         masterminds who never invest in backup plans... are they

         spin-off gamekeeper drama TED AND RALPH (9.20pm, Sun,
         BBC2)?... both protagonists of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (8.40pm,
         Sun, C4) and the subsequent THE JOHNNY VEGAS TV SHOW
         (10.35pm, Sun, C4) find solace in sculpture, though failed
         light entertainer Vegas is funnier, weirder... oddly, geek
         exploit of the week isn't THE ROYAL INSTITUTION CHRISTMAS
         LECTURES - about "The Body" (lunchtime-ish, Mon-Fri, BBC2),
         nor dullsville sequels STAR TREK IV: THE VOYAGE HOME - with
         the whales (1.40pm, Mon, BBC1) or INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST
         CRUSADE - with Sean Connery (6.05pm, Mon, BBC1) but
         hyper-dense Disney cyber-classic THE BLACK HOLE (10.30am,
         Mon, BBC1)... and when SFX Magazine recently effused over
         the "acting ability" on show in superb teen horror comedy
         series BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (8pm, Wed, BBC2), one
         suspects that what they meant to say was "teenage
         cleavage"... 

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; a wider outing for Enemy Of The State this week, but
         otherwise it's the usual depressingly uplifting seasonal
         fare... there's lush CGIs of heaven and hell (what, more
         convincing than "Spawn"?) - but, as Hamlet might put it, the
         presence of Robin Williams in treacly afterlife romance WHAT
         DREAMS MAY COME (imdb: wife / angel / car-crash / death /
         devil / dream / flashback / reincarnation / loss /
         woman-painter / painting / colors / doctor / god / heaven /
         hell / illusion / marriage / religion / search / soul-mates
         / soul / suicide) must give us pause. Like The Onion says,
         "It is not yet known whether Williams plays a doctor or a
         professor" - just remember: bearded Williams good;
         clean-shaven Williams *bad!*... and brainy Culkin kid climbs
         on top of dopey, conveniently giant classmate to create the
         hybrid hero called THE MIGHTY (imdb: death / murder /
         sickness / fireworks / grandparents / misfit / family /
         friendship / outsider / symbiosis / handicap / king-arthur /
         knights / quest / imagination). Also features Trek and
         Terminator references; Sharon Stone, Harry Dean Stanton,
         brief Gillian Anderson and Meat Loaf; and not to be confused
         with current US release Mighty Joe Young, or upcoming UK
         release Meet The Mighty Joe Black, or - oh never mind...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         "TRIBUTE SITES"&gt;&gt; A quieter year for NTK's merry band of
         imitators, with the world eagerly awaiting the 9th issue of
         THE LARD ENQUIRER (<a href="http://www.lard.com/html/enquirer_.htm">http://www.lard.com/html/enquirer_.htm</a> )
         -  last expected 2/1/98 (sic)... Mike Masnick's UP-TO-DATE (
         <a href="http://www.techdirt.com/uptodate/">http://www.techdirt.com/uptodate/</a> ) now politely cites us in
         his FAQ, and resembles a version of NTK with occasional
         explanations instead of just ranting buzzwords (oh and you
         can go back to using "Berating The Obvious", Mike, it's not
         like we've trademarked it)... and finally, NINFOMANIA (
         non-archived at <a href="http://www.ninfomania.com">http://www.ninfomania.com</a> ) bravely
         retaliated to our playful teasing of the last few weeks.
         We're prepared to concede that they *did* know the Onion
         Instant Win Airbag story was a spoof, considering the minor
         updates they (or someone) carried out since everyone was
         last sending it to each other approximately 2 years ago. But
         they haven't yet answered our more pressing query: does that
         mean that their music and book reviews might be spoofs too?

            God bless them, readers - and us, and you - every one!
