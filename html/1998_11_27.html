</span><span class="item">         CLIFF STANFORD'S REDBUS announced their first funding move
         this week. In an exciting move away from cliche, Cliff has
         invested in the British film industry: an
         underexposed sector with great potential for growth. Living
         up to his expressed intent to fund "unique" ideas, the first
         Redbus film - unlike any other British film we've ever seen
         - is a gritty expose of the gangster underworld of South
         London. Tellingly, it's called "Out of Depth".

</span><span class="item">         The world of new media TV continues to attract innovative
         approaches in marketing: take DIXONS, who with admirable
         pluck, have been attempting to sell ON DIGITAL digiboxes in
         areas where no-one can receive a digital signal. Not a
         problem: rumour has it that some demonstrations of "digital
         quality" are being arranged by hiding a DVD round the back of
         the showroom models. Well, that's *technically* a
         demonstration of the quality, isn't it? No problems with TV
         coverage for ONLINE MAGIC's Rob Passmore, who was so
         involved in working out the confidential fee for OM's
         Interactive TV pitch to British Airways, that he sent the
         spreadsheet as an attachment to all his competitors on the
         public I-TV mailing list. Now *that's* broadcasting!

</span><span class="item">         We all have our own reasons for not using Microsoft Office.
         Some don't like the bloated feature set. Others are using
         unsupported operating systems, like Linux, or Solaris, or
         OS/2. And a few of us don't use it because our intern was so
         horrified that we wrote NTK using Word, he made us
         uninstall it and convert all our macros to Vi. During that
         difficult crossover period, we briefly learned to love
         Stardivision's STAROFFICE, a multi-platform clone of the
         Office suite. This package replicates the Office look 'n'
         feel to an eery, doppelganger extent - right down to the
         menu settings, file formats and an ability to slow a
         turbo-injected PC to a crawl when the whim takes it. We've
         heard better things of the newest version, although there's
         still an element of "Microsoft software has bugs: everyone
         else has understandable teething difficulties". It's free for
         Personal Use, and now available in a tangy Windows flavour,
         as well as OS/2 and that weirdo hippy freeware UNIX-clone
         thing.

         FRIDAY NIGHT'S ALL WRIGHT (10.40pm, Fri, ITV)... BBC2
         struggles to get through an hour-plus of dance culture
         without using adjectives "banging", "wicked" in Pete Tong's
         CLUBLIFE 98 (12.10am, Fri, BBC2), featuring The Prodigy,
         Fatboy Slim, Massive Attack, and - possibly unrelated - bad
         language and male nudity... while comic book wannabe DARKMAN
         (11.40pm, Fri, BBC1) chases Frances McDormand away from Sam
         Raimi into the arms of - the Coens!... missing Comic Relief?
         Here's hoping STEPHEN FRY'S LIVE FROM THE LIGHTHOUSE (9pm,
         Sat, C4) will deliver that tricky mix of bad-taste humour
         and heartfelt sermonising, including Mel, Sue, and a sort of
         "Rock'N'Roll AIDS Years" from the folks who brought you
         controversial Radio 4 comedy quiz, King Stupid... if only
         those krazy cultists weren't so keen to commit
         Jonestown-style suicide, ponders WACO: THE RULES OF
         ENGAGEMENT (10pm, Sat, BBC2), maybe we'd find out if they
         really are destroyed evidence of CIA mind-control...
         similar-themed EVERYMAN (10.30pm, Sun, BBC1) and LOCKERBIE:
         A NIGHT REMEMBERED (7.45pm, Sun, C4) veer towards
         unfortunate mid-air collision... and too much footie, not
         enough autism in Nick Hornby's obsessive romance FEVER PITCH
         (9.30pm, Sun, C4)... "sensationalist tell-all documentaries
         exaggerate, make things up" reveals sensationalist, tell-all
         documentary ON AIR: THE TRUTH ABOUT TV (11.15pm, Mon,
         BBC2)... admit it, you were hoping that Robin Williams
         vehicle SEIZE THE DAY (10.55pm, Mon, C5) was the Dead Poets
         Society spin-off TV series, where a different pupil kills
         himself every week... pointless sci-fi comparisons continue
         in the "Bionic Woman" series opener of QED (9.30pm, Tue,
         BBC1)... no obvious explanation for ratings-grabbing star
         fests STARS IN THEIR EYES CELEBRITY SPECIAL (8pm, Wed, ITV)
         - Vorderman as Cher - and inverse-sexism charity slave
         auction MEN FOR SALE (9pm, Wed, ITV)... and, classic nuke
         comedy status aside, kudos to DR STRANGELOVE (12.05am, Thu,
         BBC1) and its "no fighting in the war room" humour - for at
         least partly inspiring hacker fave WarGames...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; "It's a competent Elmore Leonard adaptation!"
         trumpets everyone who cares, but George Clooney, Jennifer
         "Anaconda" Lopez crime romance OUT OF SIGHT (imdb: murder /
         jail-break / prison / robbery / bank-robbery /
         based-on-novel / boxing / diamonds / kidnapping) is written
         by the guy who did the last "good" Elmore Leonard
         adaptation, Get Shorty, so be warned...  style wins again
         over average content as cop shrinks Kevin Spacey, Samuel L
         Jackson phone-battle to decide who deserves the title THE
         NEGOTIATOR (imdb: hostage / police) - yet surely they could
         have been talked out of a 140 minute run-time?... and
         another well-worn theme, the '70s Jewish family sex/class
         teen comedy, er, comes of age among the SLUMS OF BEVERLY
         HILLS (imdb: black-comedy / coming-of-age / sexual / drugs)
         - it's The Fresh Princess Of Bel Air!... take your pic from
         the latest wacko Brit-made restricted release romances, with
         Jude "Shopping" Law's THE WISDOM OF CROCODILES (imdb:
         vampire) rather darker than alternate Sliding Doors comedy
         IF ONLY (imdb: also known as The Man With Rain In His
         Shoes), featuring Charlotte "Marmalade Atkins: The
         Naughtiest Girl In The World" Coleman, and Notting Hill. "If
         only men and women were exactly the same", ponders the
         poster for this one, missing the rather obvious evolutionary
         reasons why they aren't...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CONSUMERISM WILL EAT ITSELF&gt;&gt; *two* new instant meal thrills
         this week, with the long-awaited debut of CROSSE &amp; BLACKWELL
         NEW YORK TAKE OUT microwaveable frozen noodles, in US
         TV-style top-opening cartons! Faint bitter odour of hot wet
         cardboard while cooking (a la microwave french fries), and
         at UKP1.99, they're replicating both the recognisable
         flavour of a "real" Chinese takeaway - *and* a substantial
         portion of the price... clocking in at a more reasonable
         UKP0.99-1.49 (vegetarian-top predator) are TESCO
         PASTA/RICE/NOODLE POTS, 350g of fresh carbohydrate with
         thick, tasty sauces - a real high-end Pot Noodle competitor,
         though with much-reduced shelf life (4-7 days?)...
         meanwhile, delightfully named reader JAY GOOBY points out
         that never-actually-seen-in-America take-out cartons are
         available from WOK WOK in London's Soho (and possibly other
         branches) - a matter on which our transatlantic
         correspondents remain suspiciously, tellingly silent...
         random, desperate mix-and-matching continues in chocolate,
         throwing up semi-sickly treats like CADBURY'S NUTS ABOUT
         CARAMEL, which would be quite pleasant without the nagging
         doubt that "Nuts In Caramel", or even "Caramel About Nuts"
         would be a far more accurate description... still, now we
         know that Mint Crunchies have appeared intermittently since
         the 1970s, thanks to Nicholas Whittaker's SWEET TALK
         (Gollancz, UKP16.99), UKP), a largely subjective geek-tone
         social history of UK confection. Much better on stuff he
         remembers (1960s onwards), and - fatal flaw - no index!...
         probably a proper books round-up next time, but also
         tempting your Amazon account this week: the various TOP
         SECRET RECIPES ("Kitchen Clones of America's Favourite
         Brand-Name Foods") by Tood Wilbur (Penguin US, US$10.95).
         KFC, Egg McMuffins, even Mrs Fields' Cookies carefully
         reverse-engineered, but obscure US ingredients/measurements
         made our DIY Mars disgusting... which leaves us with this
         month's official "taste abomination" award, tied between the
         self-explanatorily revolting TREACLE TOFFEE ROLLOs and the
         ill-advised NESTLE TOFFEE CRISPMAS ("Toffee, Crisped Rice
         and *Spicy Fruit* Filled Milk Chocolate"). Crap name, foul
         taste, and the pseudo-fascist slogan "The special recipe of
         Toffee Crispmas is enhanced by Nestle's proud chocolate
         heritage" gives it a fighting chance: we'll leave it to Bad
         Candy headquarters <a href="http://www.geocities.com/NapaValley/2066/">http://www.geocities.com/NapaValley/2066/</a>
         to taste both and decide...
