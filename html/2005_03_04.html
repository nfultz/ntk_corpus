</span><span class="item">          Don't do popular things! Stop it! The government's Green
          Paper on the BBC caught the corporation in the "manic" stage
          of its traditional bi-polar swing. As the BBC continues to
          frenzedly chase ratings, the BBC was warned that it was
          getting too commercial, and should return to producing
          high-quality output untouched by popularist taint. Next
          charter, in 2016, of course, the BBC will be warned that it
          is too elitist, and should start trying to pander to popular
          tastes. But in the mean time, what of THE CREATIVE ARCHIVE,
          the BBC's plan to free at least some of its content for
          remixing under a more liberal license? "Likely to be popular
          with the public", warns the government, and rumbles that the
          it should be the very first experimental subject of the new
          BBC Trust's "public value and market impact tests". With
          commercial radio already leering hopefully at the Beeb's
          radio back catalogue, will the Archive be the first piece of
          meat thrown to the "stop being so popular so we don't have 
          to compete" crowd? Or will those keen commercial types
          realise that, when it comes to "opening up new markets",
          everyone getting it for free always beats one company paying
          for access?

</span><span class="item">          Of course, for those who might consider the BBC license to
          be "dirty money", there *are* other ways of subsidising the
          release of freely licensed works. Jason Clifford's UK FREE
          SOFTWARE NETWORK, for example - the ISP that spends all its
          profits in donations to free software. The blood and sweat
          and toil of Clifford's obsessive altruism has now borne
          fruit, and the Association for Free Software is handing out
          the first round of money. Just write your grant proposal and
          send it off to them. There's UKP1500 to give away, with
          hopefully more to come. Yay! Free as in money!

          Cocoaliciousness of it; it's the funky APL sideburns that's 
          made F-SCRIPT so tempting. F-Script is a scripting language 
          for MacOS X that takes that OS's object frameworks and slips 
          them into a Smalltalk syntax, then left-hooks it all with an 
          inexplicably neat multiple receiver syntax called OOPAL which 
          lets you use things called "message templates" to fire off the 
          same message to an array of objects, and ponce around like you 
          just don't need loops or iterators any more. Soon you'll 
          realise that this is brilliant, yet there's almost nothing you 
          can do with F-Script. But wait! Along comes F-Script 
          Everywhere that - in theory - allows you to browse and probe 
          ObjC objects in any running application. And, finally, when 
          you tire of that, the author hints that the next version will 
          give F-Script the ability to create new classes of its own, 
          which is what it desperately needs to become a first-class 
          scripting citizen. In the meantime, come for the OOPAL, stay 
          for the OOPAL, leave taking the OOPAL with you to your own 
          weirdo language.

          9 SONGS ( <a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/">http://www.bbfc.co.uk/</a> : Contains frequent strong 
          real sex)...
