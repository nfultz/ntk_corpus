</span><span class="item">         Over UKP500,000 of DVDs were taken from an Essex laserdisc
         store last week - and the organisation we'd apply the word
         "suspect" to is the FEDERATION AGAINST COPYRIGHT THEFT.
         According to the Basildon Evening Echo, police seized
         "imported items which are either banned in this country or
         are in an uncertified format" - in other words the US market
         Region 1 DVDs which everyone has been buying until the
         official launch of UK Region 2 systems next week.
         Coincidence? Surely not. FACT apparently plan to prosecute
         on criminal charges of copyright infringement (ludicrously,
         outside their home territory, legitimate Region 1 DVDs are
         regarded as pirate copies), and for selling films that
         haven't been certificated by the BBFC (presumably much too
         busy finishing Carmageddon 2). Inexplicably, FACT seem to
         have tolerated *exactly the same situation* among imported
         video games for some time now, though - on the other hand -
         legal UK games don't suffer from "compression artefacts",
         "white spots", and "peoples' faces going the opposite way to
         their heads", as some Region 2 DVDs appear to.

</span><span class="item">         Come into my parlour, says the spider to the... other
         spider. Why did LYCOS feel it had to spend $83 million
         buying WIRED DIGITAL, when their own patent lawyers say that
         the only profitable bit of it - HotBot - is in breach of
         Lycos's own search engine patents? We reckon that, like
         almost everyone else connected with the last days of Wired
         (including us), they're just doing it for revenge. For that
         "Wired: Inktomi, Tired: Lycos" dig in Wired 3.12. For 4.09's
         prophetic recommendation to sell Lycos short ("The search
         engine market is ripe for disaster"). For... oh, what's the
         use. You can do Hotbot searches for "Lycos" as well as we
         can. Let's all just wave goodbye with a suitably apt
         pull-quote from issue 2.06, out the month Lycos, Inc was
         formed (and Wired ran a big blurb on Yahoo): "Most things
         people do", wrote Gary Wolf, "shouldn't be remembered.
         Maybe forgetting is good." Grope for the snooze button, 
         WiReD, and wave goodnight.

</span><span class="item">         They're baaack. Just as you'd forgotten about that
         long-promised crypto legislation, the old familiar faces
         begin to make those old, muffled grumblings. DTI Minister
         BARBARA ROCHE announced her enthusiastic - but vague -
         support for e-commerce this week, which is traditionally a
         prelude for some monstrous error or another. Watch closely
         then for more strange hints leading up to Monday 19/10/98's
         ICX conference, the moment voted most likely for the new
         proposals to be revealed. As befits such an important new
         law, the consultation period would have to be jammed into
         November, and a Draft Bill pumped out by December to get it
         into next year's legislative session. Which means you'll
         have to act fast if you want to spot those flapping "Access
         for Law Enforcement" provisions hanging out of the bill's
         baggy pants.

         bloodfest, with us technical sorts chuckling in the corner

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; we still think that Wallace and Gromit could beat up
         MTV claymation import CELEBRITY DEATHMATCH (11.05pm, Fri,
         C4)... and a good argument for a Cthulhu spin-off series in
         Lovecraft compilation NECRONOMICON (1.15am, Fri, C4)... big
         kids up and down the land will be hiding behind the sofa for
         zany, irreverent etc BLUE PETER NIGHT (6-7pm; 8.55-11.05pm,
         Sat, BBC2) - oops, sorry, wrong cult TV cliche... we do hope
         it wasn't Morgan Freeman passing inside info to Kevin Spacey
         to further complicate the drizzling nightmare of SE7EN
         (9.05pm, Sun, BBC1)... at last, another zany, irreverent etc
         look at the week's news, but the amiable idiots running
         STUFF THE WEEK (11.40pm, Mon, ITV) are probably breathing
         easier now they're not up against the erratically amusing
         but respectably slick 11 O'Clock Show... an extraordinarily
         camp Jeremy Irons sets Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson
         ridiculous puzzles, not least of which is to extract some
         coherent storyline from DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE (9pm, Tue,
         ITV)... you kind of hope that Charlie "the not very funny
         one from The Fast Show" Higson is going to do all the
         interviews in his new movie series KISS KISS BANG BANG
         (11.05pm, Tue, C4) like the "Ah, Ted" sketch - the title is
         the Japanese name for James Bond... why should C5 have all
         the fun, asks C4, with its new 3-part series on the sexual
         revolution or something, explosively titled SEX BOMB (9pm,
         Wed-Thu, C4) - or is it another Chris Morris spoof?... if
         it's the same "eyes in the back of the head" nanotech repeat
         of THE OUTER LIMITS (11.15pm, Wed, BBC2), then it's truly
         the worst The Fly rip-off of all time... and surely new ITV
         consumer affairs show WE CAN WORK IT OUT (7.30pm, Thu, ITV)
         must be tempted to tackle whether viewers of BBC's Watchdog
         are really getting what they expect, considering almost
         every edition is followed by an upheld complaint by a
         featured company over its unfair treatment on the show...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; you're surrounded by clever plotting, strong
         performances and an actual satrical edge - but in the end
         THE TRUMAN SHOW (imdb: morality / boat / insanity /
         mother-son / car / tearjerker / traffic-lights / ego /
         small-town / identity / movie-studio / reality / god /
         bridge / futuristic / fantasy / crazed-producer / storm /
         performance / simple-man / rain / 1990s / media-hype /

         pursuit / adoption / product-placement / blockbuster /
         revenge / producer / chase / escape / tv / corruption /
         surreal / beach / fake-death) just turns out to be a big
         Hollywood movie after all! Plus, we're convinced that the
         <a href="http://www.photomosaic.com">www.photomosaic.com</a> guy fiddled the edges on the posters,
         possibly after not getting image approval from Carrey (or
         his agent)... plenty of what <a href="http://www.screenit.com">www.screenit.com</a> calls "Tense
         family scenes" in above-average Merchant Ivory period
         costume drama A SOLDIER'S DAUGHTER NEVER CRIES (imdb:
         based-on-novel), though this time, it's the period costumes
         of Paris and the USA in the 1960s!... and Tinseltown
         Cinderella Drew Barrymore gets her big break in fairy-tale
         re-telling EVER AFTER (imdb: leonardo-da-vinci / cinderella)
         - better than you might think, with some almost-Princess
         Bride elements, but not quite enough "Leonardo Da Vinci"...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         EDIBLES INTERNATIONAL&gt;&gt; there's little to tempt the UK
         palette in the way of new confections, what with NESTLE's
         not particularly ace VENTURA ("The Chocolate Covered
         Bubblegum Chew Bar"), and the revolting "CHUNKY" - yet
         another desperate attempt by CADBURY'S to come up with a
         Christmas Creme Egg, with truffles and toffee in it... so,
         why not ask your US friends to send over a box or two of
         official SOUTH PARK CHEESY POOFS? - like cheesy Wotsits, but
         with a coarser texture... also Stateside, libertarian sf
         author (aren't they all?) Victor Milan has been warning of
         the MCDONALDS Y2k-style "XX billion burgers served" bug -
         only two digits on the signs and they're due to hit 100 any
         day now... still, not quite as scary as the Dawkinsburgers
         at <a href="http://www.brunching.com/toys/toy-hamburger.html">http://www.brunching.com/toys/toy-hamburger.html</a> ...
         JAPANESE KEBAB fan site <a href="http://www.hh.iij4u.or.jp/~arg/">http://www.hh.iij4u.or.jp/~arg/</a> acts
         as a powerful warning against mixing too many cuisines, so
         you could stay here and look forward to exotica like FRED
         FRUITY CHEESE SPREAD (a "natural soft cheese strawberry
         flavoured product"), KP/BRANNIGANS DELICRISPS ("a thicker,
         harder eat with an appetising darker colour"), or ORIENTAL
         EXPRESS NOODLE POTS, which aren't plastic tubs but genuine
         US sitcom-style cardboard cartons (that we've never been
         able to find when we're actually in America)... we want:
         <a href="http://www.lightvision.com/">http://www.lightvision.com/</a> ... and finally, this
         over-helpful shelf-talker seen in MARKS AND SPENCERS: "Did
         you know that Whole Milk is naturally 95 per cent Fat Free?"
         Well, thanks for sharing, M&amp;S, as well as for inadvertently
         (or deliberately?) revealing that all those "95 per cent fat
         free" products are at least as fattening as whole milk...
