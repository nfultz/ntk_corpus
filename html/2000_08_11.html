</span><span class="item">         It's curious that the row over KATIE.COM, the
         privately-owned UK domain appropriated by Penguin as the
         title of a chatroom abuse novel, took so long to become
         public, when the book first came out in May. But hey, if you
         discovered a major publisher was cheerily libelling and/or
         driving traffic to your site, wouldn't *you* try and do a
         quiet little deal with them first? Proving it is possible to
         take on the big guys and win is the owner of STING.COM, who
         fought off an attack by the well-meaning rainforest-warrior
         of the same name, partly on the grounds that more people
         might have heard of the site owner (who plays Quake using
         the handle "Sting") than the middle-aged pop-jazz has-been.
         And completing the craze is upcoming garage vocalist CRAIG
         DAVID, whose soft-spoken accounts of "What I Did Over The
         Half-Term Holidays" have proved so popular among the UK's
         now largely pre-pubescent record-buying public. Craig
         apparently namechecks the URL "<a href="http://www.cd.com">www.cd.com</a>" extensively
         during the "Booty Man" track on his new album (out on
         Monday), seemingly under the impression that this is his own
         website. Of course, the URL he *should* be publicising is
</span><span class="trailing_urls">         <a href="http://www.craigdavid.co.uk">www.craigdavid.co.uk</a> , because cd.com is a domain owned by
         Digi, "the world's leading supplier of multi- function
         adapters for server-based communications systems."

</span><span class="item">         Despite the recent "online credit card details" hysteria
         (isn't it the merchants and CC companies who are liable for
         most fraudulent use, a fact they obviously prefer not to
         publicise), you can always rely on DEMON to come up with a
         more low-tech method of exposing that ultra-valuable customer
         info. Their latest exploit reportedly involved velvet-gloved
         cat-burglars, who "climbed up the scaffolding and nicked
         a NT server (which paged down but no on NOC duty knew what the
         machine did, so they did nothing)." Police were called to the
         scene, but after they left, the master-thieves (possibly "the
         same ones", our source believes) "climbed in again and nicked
         another NT server, this time one that holds company files,
         templates and manages office printers. Some staff then went
         home as they could no longer do their work."

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CONFECTIONERY THEORY&gt;&gt; something of a "crunchy" texture to
         this month's sightings, with the national roll-out of NESTLE
         COLA SMARTIES prompting widespread reaction, from "officially
         rank" (DAVID GENTLE) to "FLASH" WILSON's more complex theory
         that preferences are occupationally determined: "The web team
         eat Cola Smarties, the backend team eat Jelly and Icecream
         Fruit Pastilles - but I eat strawberry Campini"... while MARK
         SAVAGE defended the antipodean trend for making sweets out of
         malted-milk drinks [NTK 2000-07-28], claiming that "the
         ballerina's favourite - Malteesers - are just chocolate-coated
         Horlicks powder. Think about it"... PepsiCo-owned Smiths-
         absorbers WALKERS are up to something, with what they claim is
         a new "Spicy" version of MONSTER MUNCH debuting in August,
         plus some sort of legal battle in Ireland (where the Spicy
         flavour apparently originated) with previous MM licensees,
         Tayto, who have continued to manufacture a rival brand called
         "Mighty Munch"... MATT HALL meanwhile describes Golden
         Wonder's response, WOTSITS WAFFLES, as "cheesy powder OD, huge
         maize squares guaranteed to choke anyone under the age of
         fifteen"... as SIMON BRADBURY launches his one-man mission to
         find out what's happened to GOLDEN WONDER'S WORCESTER SAUCE
         WHEAT CRUNCHIES - are they being edged out by these fancy new
         Walker's brands, or perhaps just replaced by GW's own Salt n
         Vinegar Wheat Crunchies? Bradbury considers both possibilities
         "unacceptable"... but product-spotter of the month award goes
         to former face of Cadbury's Creme Eggs MATT LUCAS, who
         "returned from France" with what's believed to be the first
         example, captured in the wild, of a TWIX TOP - "about the
         shape of two Twix sticks side-by-side, but maybe only half as
         tall." Word is that nationwide sampling of these will continue
         through August, with a full "back to school" ad campaign (79p
         for a pack of 6) in September. "It's mainly a bland biscuit,"
         Matt reports, "but has a small amount of chocolate and caramel
         on top. Hence the title." Either that, or it's an allusion to
         "Lager top", to create the impression of a lighter, less
         potent variant of Twix: Classic...
