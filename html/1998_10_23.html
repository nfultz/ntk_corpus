</span><span class="item">         Think you've had a bad week? Allow us to make it worse. DTI
         civil servants spelt out on Monday the details of the UK's
         long-awaited crypto legislation. Under the new law,
         Government-approved encryption authorities will be obliged
         to keep a copy of your private key, and hand it over to the
         authorities when requested by a "senior police officer" (as
         opposed to the Home Secretary, as in phone taps). It will be
         a criminal act for these authorities to tell you that your
         key has been revealed. Now, in a better world (such as the
         one we're just leaving), no-one would use these government
         authorities because - as every expert in crypto has warned -
         a key escrow system like this is fundamentally insecure.
         You're better off with a free copy of PGP (or even your
         browser's security features).  So, to encourage you, the
         government has declared only digital signatures created by
         these approved companies will be accepted in law. What's
         that you say? What have digital signatures and encrypting
         messages got in common? Well, you're right - nothing. But
         you can bet the lawmakers won't mention that. This is a
         piece of legislation that requires an ignorant public to
         succeed.
</span><span class="item_space">   
</span><span class="item">         Talking of which, why haven't you heard of this before? While
         the government have yet to release any information through
         official channels, DTI personnel at the ICX conference
         confirm all of the above, and have declared the basic
         principles of this regulation "not open for discussion".
         In this, as so many other matters, they're wrong. DTI
         officials have their own signing authority - a third party
         known as Parliament. Next week, in a NTK special, we'll tell
         you how you can hack into this trusted service provider
         through a backdoor known as "public accountability", and
         that way decode what these buffoons are assuming is 
         a secret transmission only they should understand.

         can imagine, and they haven't done much to speed up the page
         rendering as far as we can see. MacOS *is* noticeably
         faster, but the full text search eats up hard drive space.
         At 13 megs, the Netscape download only takes one meg more
         than the 4.0. At 58UKP, the MacOS isn't cheap. Netscape's

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; comedy horror extravaganza tonight, with Brian De
         Palma's typically understated PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE rock
         opera (12.30am, BBC1, Fri) rounding off the terror of THE
         BBC NEW COMEDY AWARDS 1998 (11.45pm, BBC1, Fri) and a "new"
         (but not so you'd notice) series of HAVE I GOT NEWS FOR YOU
         (10pm, BBC2, Fri)... while C4 expertly fields the especially
         poignant age-difference romance episode of FRASIER (10pm,
         Fri, C4)... clocks go back on Saturday - right back to the
         late '80s, apparently, during Prince theme evening A NIGHT
         FOR THE ARTIST (11.45pm-2.50am GMT, Sat, C4)... or a
         different brand of semi-surreal, much-quoted, sex-obsessed
         performers on MONTY PYTHON WEEKEND (from 8pm, Sat,
         Paramount)... for once, a perfect cult movie changeover with
         John Waters' SERIAL MOM (10pm, Sun, C4) ending just in time
         for Jonathan "Silence Of The Lambs" Demme's lesbian prison
         trash debut, CAGED HEAT (11.50pm, Sun, BBC2)... you can
         already imagine what a speeded-up Victor Lewis-Smith
         commentating on old TV commercials would be like, so no need
         to watch ADS INFINITUM (9.50pm, Mon, BBC2)... students
         compete in Will McDonald's zany Uni quiz CARRY ON CAMPUS
         (6.45pm, Mon, BBC2) - but how would they fare against the
         rather more exacting criteria posed by Rutger Hauer in THE
         HITCHER (9pm, Mon, C5)?... it can't/doesn't get any better,
         so feel free to turn over after the "Skeet Surfing" bit of
         post-Airplane goof-off TOP SECRET (11.10pm, Tue, BBC1)...
         especially as they're once again taunting us with
         traditional - and how temporary? - double-bill THE LARRY
         SEINFELD SHOW (11.10pm, Tue, BBC2)... BLACK BRITAIN (7.30pm,
         Wed, BBC2) profiles Mekon-like Jamaican government tech
         adviser 13-year-old... while IS IT LEGAL? (9.30pm, Wed, C4)
         battles for title of dullest office sitcom with final -
         they've promised - series of DROP THE DEAD DONKEY (9pm, Wed,
         C4)... and finally, "Wouldn't it be a great front
         organisation for showbiz homosexuals?" is just one of the
         questions Jon Ronson won't be asking his Scientologist
         guests on the new religion-oriented run of FOR THE LOVE OF
         (12.25am, Thu, C4)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; Roger Ebert, again on fine form, asks "How does
         Michael Myers support himself" in the long years between his
         last film and post-Scream self-referential Psycho in-joke
         HALLOWEEN H20: TWENTY YEARS LATER (imdb: road-stop /
         alcoolism / drugs / traumatism / private-college / truck /
         elevator / pumpkin / fire-extinguisher / ax / halloween /
         boarding-school / serial-killer / heroine /
         throwing-knives): "I picture him working in a fast-food
         joint. 'He never spoke much, but boy, could he dice those
         onions!'"... Todd Haynes, whose debut was retelling The
         Karen Carpenter Story with Barbie Dolls, disproves his
         poster slogan "the secret of becoming a star is knowing to
         behave like one" by producing something that looks like an
         entertainingly arty '70s version of Citizen Kane, but is
         actually just a disappointing Bowie-bio cover version
         recorded down a VELVET GOLDMINE (imdb: bisexual / glam-rock
         / music / gay / 1970s)... Dreamworks' other fx-heavy war
         romp of this summer, Joe Dante's sub-standard SMALL SOLDIERS
         (imdb: part-animated / artificial-intelligence /
         part-computer-animation / intelligence / animatronics) pits
         Spinal Tap voices against The Dirty Dozen; the US cut was so
         violent that the age-group the merchandise was aimed at
         couldn't get in to see it... in another bittersweet tribute
         to a deceased star (a la Small Soldiers' Phil Hartman), the
         canine lead in kiddie feelgood sports nonsense AIR BUD
         (imdb: basketball / dog) has subsequently died of cancer...
         a national roll-out for supposedly action-packed
         pseudo-Shakespeare yawn EL1ZABETH (imdb: historical /
         period) - imagine a non-sci-fi version of Dune, with Kathy
         "Waynetta Slob" Burke as Baron Harkonnen... and the worst
         line in Minnie Driver costume race drama romance THE
         GOVERNESS? (imdb: period / sephardic / judaism / victorian /
         consumption / 1800s / photography) Either "I used to think
         that a changeling would come and eat my kidneys" or "I could
         drown in your hair - it's like treacle"... 

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MAGS&gt;&gt; new PSX demodisc mag STATION (UKP3.95, out now) is,
         as feared, simultaneously more offensive yet more boring
         than the OFFICIAL PLAYSTATION MAGAZINE to which it obviously
         aspires (although, unlike the latter, it doesn't - yet -
         seem to be under the misapprehension that a few photos of a
         PR party that the staff went to somehow constitutes a "news
         item"). Howlers include: god-awful coverdisc (non-playable
         Tomb Raider 3 - wahey!), *two* terrible Lara Croft pieces,
         excessive use of exclamation marks, a reviewer under the
         impression that Command And Conquer was based on "Dune 2000"
         (p60), and a media pack that's even more illiterate than the
         editorial: <a href="http://www.rapide.co.uk/station.html">http://www.rapide.co.uk/station.html</a> ...
         Russian-Doll-style, Station #1 even includes a preview of
         Rapide's new multi-format TOTAL CONTROL (UKP1.50, out
         today). Presumably targeted at the same market as Future's
         ARCADE (still due Nov we think - and no longer called
         "Arcadia" due to confusion with the Duran Duran spin-off of
         the same name), the thoroughly dull TC #1 does seem to avoid
         the trap of other Edge-wannabes: Dave Perry's previous
         X-Gen, the appalling Ultimate Future Gaming, and (of
         course), Edge itself... "just for fun" deadpool - who'll
         tank first: FRANK, DELUXE or UNCUT? (Hint: Uncut publishers
         IPC look after their own)... new TIME OUT website terrible,
         seems to avoid useful listings information for lame student
         features... "email deliverable" <a href="http://www.futuregamer.com">http://www.futuregamer.com</a>
         (free, due Thu 05/11/98) promises to be "less than 256K" -
         but will unzipping the weekly HTML be just one click too
         far?... NTK completists will of course already have the new
         INTERZONE (UKP3), containing a blistering behind-the-scenes
         expose of our low-budget TV show (p30)... Bizarre, described
         by its assistant editor as "Fortean Times's slutty little
         sister", produces a trampy sibling of its own: one-off
         showbiztastic CREAM, in three weeks' time... yet most
         predictable content of the month goes to FRONT (right down
         to the UKP1 launch price, out now) - it's "FHM for
         teenagers", though some readers may find that tautology
         excessive. Designed like Escape (confusingly) without all
         the unconvincing PC bits, it's got semi-celebrity
         semi-nudity, a distributor-scaring obsession with criminals
         and corpses, Adam "Local Heroes" Hart-Davis, "what makes a
         spot appear" (p95), and is hopefully as doomed as
         predecessors LM ("Leisure Monthly", late '80s, not Living
         Marxism) and vastly superior Sassy spin-off, Dirt...
