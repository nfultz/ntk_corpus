</span><span class="item">         R-r-r-rrunarahnd! This week's celebrity resignations: BRIAN
         HOOK, programmer at id software, chief architect of the 3DFX
         Glide API, and original singer of 911's "A Little Bit More";
         RASTERMAN, creator of the Enlightenment Window manager,
         GNOME project employee, lyricist for the Wailers; NATHAN
         MYHRVOLD, head of Microsoft Research, no discernable
         achievements, inspiration for mid-seventies novelty hit "I'm
         Nathan Myhrvold And I Live in A Hole". Like everyone else,
         we assumed they were taking each others' jobs (".plan: this
         year, sink $5 billion R+D into new staff 'skins'"), but
         it isn't turning out that way. Brian's gone to Ultima
         rivals VERANT INTERACTIVE, Rasterman is taking some time off
         to plot the "disappearance" of his old Redhat manager, and
         Nathan... well, nobody's broken it to Nathan that he's going
         yet. Despite rock-hard sources inside and outside Microsoft
         saying that Ballmer's already put all his desktop dinosaurs
         into bin liners, Nathan's still convinced that he's just
         taking a few months holiday. Two points for Nathan to
         consider: a) wasn't that *exactly* what he told Stephen
         Hawking, just before he left him to work for Microsoft for
         15 years? b) Doesn't he know Ballmer's sense of humour yet?

</span><span class="item">         You may recall UK publishers SAVOY pioneering the legal 
         take on the graphic novel in 1992. Their comic MENG AND
         ECKER was banned principally "because it was luridly bound
         and therefore likely to attract attention from the less
         literate". They're also known for being the original
         sponsors of horror/sci-fi author M John Harrison, and
         publishers of avant garde art and erotica by Michael
         Moorcock, Sam Delany, and Charles "Silicon Man/ Anarchy
         Online" Platt. After a brief period free from hassle,
         Customs and Excise last month performed a suitably perverse
         impoundment: they've seized unsold copies of exported copies
         of Lord Horror, M&amp;E, and their new abortion Reverbstorm, as
         they're returned to the UK. Yup, books written and
         printed in the UK, confiscated because they briefly
         re-crossed a border. Just thought you should know that no
         matter how bad it gets here on the Net, it's even crazier 
         in the real world.

         [NTK 1999-03-12] - archived by, ahem, "a popular discussion 
         group search engine". Of course, we'd feel a lot happier 
         laying into this craven spinelessness if we hadn't done 
         more or less the same thing, and heeded Laurence's sensible
         encouragement to remove all our links to defamatory
         postings about him three months ago. Our sympathies, then, 
         lie with Demon. Unless it really is impossible for them to

         worth queuing up outside Wolsey Hall, Windmill Lane, Cheshunt
         (North London) for "EPISODE I - EMPIRE DAY" (Sun 1999-06-06,
         UKP10, "hotline" on 01908 671138), even though the location

</span><span class="item">         Oh, and "(Law)suits for you, sir" and "This week, I have been
         mainly shutting down: warez sites" will be the oft-repeated
         catchphrases at next week's FAST show, when the FEDERATION
         AGAINST SOFTWARE THEFT hold their annual conference in
         Bournemouth, 1999-06-09/10. Not too much to add to their basic
         stance on piracy (they're against it, apparently), but the
         session on NatWest's new "Magex" system might be entertaining:
         an e-commerce pay-per-view system that has so revolutionised
         intellectual property that they neglected to check if anyone
         else had registered magex.com, which they now *share* with an
         Italian construction company...

         applications to tidy it all up. Alternatively, why not
         download this monster German applet that lets you bloat the
         box like an overstuffed turkey, with uptime readouts, system
         temperatures, logfiles, and all the usual tat crammed in
         there, plus parse Web pages using its own text-mauling
         language. All even extend it by running external parsers -
         "like REXX or PERL", the creators say helpfully. And then,
         if you've got any RAM left, you can maybe run Notepad in 
         what's left of your screen.

         - unless NRA spokesman Charlton Heston can arm everyone else in
         the stadium given just a TWO MINUTE WARNING (11.25pm, Fri,
         BBC1)... there's Mute Witness, and now BLIND WITNESS (9pm, Fri,
         C5) - but no "Deaf-As-A-Post Witness", we note... and given
         Brian Yuzna's dire subsquent output, the odd flesh-melting orgy
         bits in SOCIETY (12.45am, Fri, BBC2) were probably fortituitous
         accidents... after last week's two-parter, SPACE: 1999 (3.55pm,
         Sat, BBC2) comes to an ignominious end in "The Dorcons"... set
         your TV on fire to properly enjoy HENDRIX NIGHT (9pm, Sat,
         BBC2)... regular Light Ent treat BEFORE THEY WERE FAMOUS (10pm,
         Sat, BBC1) has Arnie on Magpie; JUNIOR (8pm, Sat, BBC1) sees him
         bearing Emma Thompson's child - last shown approx 17 months ago
         on 1998-01-11... and going from the <a href="http://www.ntk.net/killer">http://www.ntk.net/killer</a> 
         comments, they cut a lot out before showing the sensitive
         Australians KILLER NET (10pm, Sat, C4)... the repeat of this
         week's DAWSON'S CREEK (12.10pm, Sun, C4) has excellent life-
         imitates-art-imitating-life plot - plus Rachel "She's All That"
         Leigh Cook naked... the missing link between Dumb And Dumber and
         There's Something About Mary, bawdy bowling slapstick KINGPIN
         (10pm, Sun, C4) features Bill Murray, vile comb-overs and the
         "milking" of a bull... while ALWAYS AND EVERYONE (9pm, Mon, ITV)
         is - thank god - another hospital drama... interchangable
         international docu UNDER THE SUN (9.30pm, Tue, BBC2) combines a
         look at the traditional way of life of the Shaolin monks with
         martial-arts whupass action... Dolph Lundgren pops out of "where
         are they now?" file as THE PEACEKEEPER (9pm, Tue, C5)... Richard
         E Grant and Samantha "Broken Arrow" Mathis are the two
         unappealing losers and a baby in infantile feelgooder JACK &amp;
         SARAH (10pm, Wed, C4)... will they place that annoying pizza ad
         in overrated Scorsese yawn GOODFELLAS (10pm, Wed, C5)?... and

         man left un-Bodysnatched battling lame cybernetic aliens and
         Jamie Lee Curtis aboard all-at-sea actioner VIRUS (imdb: based-
         on-comic / ship / electricity / typhoon / aliens / virus /
         computers) - hugely derivative, but that doesn't seem to have
         put anyone off "The Matrix"... dapper Don also pops up in
         extended Nike ad WITHOUT LIMITS (imdb: running / biographical /
         olympics) - "among the five finest movies about athletics ever
         made" says one imdb comment; high praise indeed... Michelle
         "who?" Pfeiffer's latest lost-child weepie sinks swiftly to THE
         DEEP END OF THE OCEAN (imdb: based-on-novel) - not based around
         Chris Searle's job-swap TV show of nearly the same name... plus
         a (reluctant) plug for overhyped live-action rave cartoon HUMAN
         TRAFFIC (imdb: UK) - somehow we doubt it really is "The last
         great film of the 90s", unless you're a suspiciously thin
         leather-faced 80s casualty still convinced that "style culture"
         is in some way relevant or interesting...

         announcement of 1p/min BT CLICK [NTK 1998-06-12], while we
         pointed out that Oftel had virtually sanctioned the whole thing
         "on the understanding that the smarter ISPs would grab a Telco
         license, and undercut it with free IP provision when they
         started receiving telco-ish revenues from the phonecall
         charges". Christ, we're smug... in other '98 (anti) news:
         LABOUR's pre-election crypto policy "disappeared" from their
         site... AIN'T IT COOL NEWS admitted that claims that 40% of Star
         Wars 1 rushes were out-of-focus were "probably exaggerated"...
         and EDGE magazine's "continued pursuit of excellence" included
         the claim that the RIDGE RACER cabinet ran at "0.4FLOPS" - an
         incredible 4/10ths of a floating point operation per second...
         oh, that short, cruel summer: ftp clients strained under the
         weight of IE 5.0 Developer Release, Apache 1.3.0, and Real
         Network's Preview of RealPlayer G2... we reported rumours of
         Shatner rapping Julius Caesar in FREE ENTERPRISE, and TV
         NATION's "return to C4"... PANASONIC withdrew a kids'
         wordprocessing program that swore fluently... the UK tooled up
         with trade shows like the "International Chemical Warfare
         Demilitarization Conference", "European Guns, Mortars and
         Ammunition Symposium", and "Undersea Defence Technology
         Europe"... while, among the stuff that never troubled our
         mailfeed again were: The World's First QUAKE POETRY COMPETITION,
         Keanu Reeves' beatnik road movie THE LAST TIME I COMMITTED
         SUICIDE, and - presumably featuring George Dawes, Dennis Pennis,
         and the usual gang of idiots - Channel 4's "new cruelty" sketch
         show BARKING...
