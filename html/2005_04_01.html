</span><span class="item">          DON'T TOUCH THE DOUGHNUTS! Just as Grokster supporters,
          weary from waiting all night for seats at the US Supreme
          Court, were tempted by pastries from the recording industry
          lawyers (who, in some sort of metaphor for the whole
          process, pay folk to wait in line for them), one is
          tempted to ask: does this high drama mean anything for the
          UK? Ah, just wait. In the ancestor to this case, 1984's
          Betamax judgement, the Supremes declared that recording TV
          shows to watch later (time-shifting) was fair use in the
          United States. That surprised a lot of copyright scholars
          at the time - but four years later, time-shifting was
          declared a explicit, limited exemption under UK copyright
          law. If making file-sharing software is seen as an illegal
          activity in the US, there's a good chance that British MPs
          will decide to make the same true here.  And after that,
          why not start having another peck at the time-shifting
          "liberty", too?

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">          And you think *your* IRC server has lamer problems. The folk
          working on Jabber, the open messaging protocol intended To
          Rule Them All, must have been pretty chuffed when the IETF
          accepted its underlying protocol as a standards track back
          in 2000. Getting increasingly less chuffed are those in
          charge of running jabber.org, the protocol's demo server.
          It sounds like Jabber is getting more and more adoption in
          the commercial world; and the commercial world doesn't seem
          to know how to set up its own chat servers. So far, the
          somewhat amazed sysadmins have watched the usual geek chat
          traffic be drowned out by: a British company called trackm8,
          which sells an anti-theft device for trucks (many of which
          sent their "I'm okay!" messages via jabber.org), a US hotel
          services company whose hundreds of kiosks report home via
          jabber.org, and two more companies too poor or technically
          innocent to run their own servers: Telecom Italia and
          Cingular. Peter St Andre, patron saint of the protocol, has
          been kicking the lamers off as fast as they appear, but it
          does beg the question: Is there a bash.org for machine-to-
          machine messages?

          copyright-unencumbered "open" map of London (then the UK) from 
          Russian satellite photography [see NTK 2005-01-21] - though, 
          ironically, some confusion about where you're actually 
          supposed to send your donations. Fortunately amateur-
          cartographic ringleader JO WALSH should be pinning down those 
          - and other - co-ordinates at the Thursday-after-next's OPEN

</span><span class="item">          The problem with wikis - no, revert that, *one* of the
          problems with wikis - is that they're too easy to code, and
          too hard to get right. They're the IRCbots of the '00s. So
          it's with some relief to see that (the Outlaw) Jimmy Wales'
          Wikipedia project has ground some good code out from the
          twin stoney mills of that project's overrun moderators and
          endless waves of public examination. MEDIAWIKI, which hit
          v1.4 this past fortnight, is the Wikipedia wiki: it's also
          easy to install, only really dependent on PHP and MySql
          (unless you want mathematical equations, in which case you
          deserve to have Objective CAML foisted your way). Its edges
          are worn smooth: editing is easy, moderating and standing
          guard over pages is easy, categorisation, uploading images,
          all very nicely tweaked. It could do with a WYKI-WYSIWIG
          textarea, some nicer Firefox helpers, and somebody shouting
          about the "Enhanced recent changes" box in preferences to
          every new user. But wait long enough, and perhaps they'll be
          there too.

          sci-fi rages almost unhindered across the schedules, in the

          Queen's "Gernsback Continuum"-style FLASH GORDON (4.10pm, Sat,

          England" for the Faust adaptation of BRAND NEW FLASHMOB OPERA 
          (8pm, Thu, BBC3)... and you can always disprove people who say 
          "the remake's never as good as the original" by pointing out 
          John Carpenter's version of "The Thing", the 1978 version of 
          INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (12midnight, Fri, BBC1), or
