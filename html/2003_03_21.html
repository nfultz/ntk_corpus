</span><span class="item">         We had our doubts about WROX PRESS' commercial nous, ever
         since they hit upon their uniquely unappealing book design
         of monochrome mugshots of tech author's faces over a lurid
         swollen red and yellow cover. But, despite the sheer reeling
         ugliness of their covers, Wrox did well. And entering any
         computer corner of American or British bookshops of the past
         few years, one would always be faced with shelf after shelf
         of the Prisoners Of Wrox. Well, now they're dead. Not the
         authors - no, they always looked like that. No, the parent
         company, Peer Information, has gone bust. Curiously, while it
         had dozens of spin-off imprints and Web ventures (Glasshaus,
         Friends of Ed, Wrox US, Wrox France, Wrox India, and so on)
         Peer Information turned out to be a family business run out
         of Birmingham ("albeit", writes one mourner, "the posh
         bit"). So, let us take a few minutes to salute this little
         known British success story, and like so many before them,
         hope they come out of receivership soon.

</span><span class="item">         Now, back to the war: and we're only a few kilometers so
         into enemy territory, but we've already got the confirmed
         surrenders of two marketing companies. Well, maybe not
         surrender: but they're certainly co-operating. Following
         last week's look at dodgy spam from supposedly stately
         organisations, PHDiq (for the RSPCA) and i-level (for the BT
         Ignite spam) are looking into why their client's mailouts 
         got sent unsolicited to dodgy addresses via cowboy spammers.
         Both CEOs say they only deal in opt-in lists, legit mailers,
         and never, ever via unsecured boxes in Argentina. And they
         want to get to the bottom of these slip-ups. Heard it
         before? Maybe: but with the EU anti-spam legislation
         creeping into reality, the result of this ongoing
         investigation is going to be very telling. If these two, big
         name, reputable companies can't separate their prestigious
         clients from the seedy underside of dodgy offshore shell
         companies and Web-crawled email addresses, who can? In the
         meantime, we're still looking for any spammish messages
         from respectable companies (and thanks to the reader who
         sent us in a spam that appeared to be sponsored by the Met
         Police. It checks out, but you had us worried for a moment.)

</span><span class="item">         Ostensibly, WORKRAVE is an applet with the simplest of jobs:
         it tells you to take a period break from typing to save your
         poor wrists. In real life, it's like one of those "let's
         build an C++ application" documentation examples gone
         completely nuts. From its humble beginnings, it's now an
         excrutiatingly well-engineered taskbar applet that runs on
         GNOME and KDE. Oh, and Windows. It's got a statistics
         feature, so it can tell you how many miles you've moved your
         mouse. Yeah, yeah, we know - but it's also got a networked
         client-server facility. Built-in. So not only can you now
         never escape from its persistent "take a break" fascism, but
         you can gather facts on how many miles *all* your mice have
         moved, from your laptop to your desktop to your VNCed Win2K
         server. It's GPLed. The author has a cafepress shop where
         you can buy Workrave t-shirts. There's also a leaflet you
         can print out and hand to your non-cult friends. The name
         appears to be a play on a $55 commercial program that does a
         similiar job - but, Jesus, what else could that do for the
         money? Operate a little crane to lift your hands up and down
         on the keys?

         (Tue 2003-03-25, time and location currently secret) are being 
         held on a boat to dissuade infiltrators, it's hard not to be

         and being in jail (he said he'd prefer being in jail, because 
         ships were just "jail - with a chance of drowning"). Here's 
         hoping there'll be no need for either at the slightly more

         ONLINE EVENTS on Trusted Computing (7pm, Thu 2003-03-27, Hill

         yes, we know that site editor Mick Hume isn't running "Living

         BANZAI (10.30pm, Thu, E4), THE PEOPLE'S BOOK OF RECORDS 
         (9.30pm, Fri, C4) is the primetime debut of Zeppotron, the

         obsessive-compulsive detective in US import MONK (5.45pm, Sat, 
         BBC2) - made by "Mandeville Films", playground insult fans may 
         be pleased to hear... and what on earth will DESIGNING THE 
         DECADES (8pm, Sat, BBC2) find to say about the 1970s?... BBC3 
         brackets the final episode of TAKEN (9pm, Sat, BBC2) with a 
         special UFO night (from 8pm, Sat, BBC3), up against THE X 
         FILES: THE MOVIE (9pm, Sat, ITV2) - itself heralding the long-
         overdue conclusion of THE X FILES: THE TV SHOW (10.45pm, Sun, 
         BBC2), though the ever-popular monkey people get their own 
         spinoff in "When Gallaghers Ruled The Earth" unsubstantiated 
         hypothesising WALKING WITH CAVEMEN (8pm, Thu, BBC1)... Dawn 
         from "Buffy" shows an early aptitude for sleuthing as HARRIET 
         THE SPY (1.05pm, Sun, BBC1)... the embarrassment of being 
         associated with a delusionally unfashionable head of state is 
         explored by both MY DAD'S THE PRIME MINISTER (6.05pm, Sun, 
         BBC1) and THE WAR FOR OIL (7.30pm, Wed, BBC2)... Guy Ritchie 
         sets his sights on the slightly less ambitious project of 
         hidden-camera justice show SWAG (8.30pm, Sun, C5)... and Tim 
         from "The Office" and the girl from the Abbey National ads 
         reappear in Simon "Men Behaving Badly" Nye's workplace sitcom 
         HARDWARE (10.05pm, Sun, ITV) - not based around the 1990 
         cyberpunk film of the same name... for anyone who failed 
         Saturday's NATIONAL RELATIONSHIP TEST (9pm, Sat, BBC1), BBC2 
         helpfully provides a selection of 5 different WAYS TO LEAVE 
         YOUR LOVER (11.20pm, Tue, BBC2)... alternative applications of 
         nuclear explosions are examined in Nicole Kidman thriller THE 
         PEACEMAKER (9pm, Wed, BBC3) and Project Orion docu TO MARS BY 
         A-BOMB (9pm, Wed, BBC4)... and thanks to DELIVERANCE (10pm, 
         Wed, C5), humming the start of "Duelling Banjos" remains the 
         ideal way to indicate that a visit to the countryside isn't
