         Amstrad PC product recall (remember?). Sold-up CEO Alan
         Sugar, aware of a good revenue stream when he sees it, has
         threatened to take the case to the US courts. Seagate must
         love that kind of talk, especially following low earning
         predictions, an unexpected tax bill of $55 million, and $25
         million down the drain thanks to the devaluation of the

         direct legal action is rare, the standard MS tactics (Fear,
         Uncertainty and Doubt) seem to scare Web hosting companies

         month. Our favourite title is MIND GRENADES, an expensive
         reprint of all that incomprehensible pre-contents bollocks
         you mistook for a Smirnoff advert in the original mag. Or
         perhaps you'll enjoy "Digerati : Encounters with the Cyber
         Elite": an elite that we note includes both Wired publisher
         Louis Rossetto ('the Buccaneer') and Wired exec editor
         Kevin Kelly ('the Saint'). Perhaps we'll just re-read our
         copy of the original Hardwired, the genuinely excellent
         1986 novel by sci-fi author Walter Jon Williams. An author,
         that Wired Ventures lawyers are currently asserting owns no
         right to the Hardwired title, and presently has no
         publisher in this country. Sigh.

         a second preview for VISUAL JAVASCRIPT, Netscape's drag-
         and-drop programming package for wimps is out there now.
         And for you HTML weenies, the World Wide Web Consortium
         released an advance draft of HTML 4.0, which includes such
         goodies as enhanced forms (nice looking buttons) and a
         tidying-up of that whole 'frames' nastiness.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV &gt;&gt; You've seen John Hughes' sloppy geekfest WEIRD
         SCIENCE (9pm, Fri, BBC2) once too many times already, so
         flip over for more sophisticated surrealism from the fresh
         series of FRASIER (10pm, Fri, C4), closely followed by
         David Lynch's insane ERASERHEAD (11.05pm, Fri, C4), which
         should put you right off sticking tadpoles in your
         radiator, if you know what I mean... OK, we forgot the
         late-night repeats of excellent software sitcom DWEEBS
         (5.05am, Sat pm/Sun am, C4) but you haven't missed many so
         far... John Wayne's classic TRUE GRIT (9.40pm, Sat, BBC2)
         surprisingly triumphs over Jean-Claude Van Damme in HARD
         TARGET (10pm, Sat, BBC1) - John Woo has made some cool
         action movies, but this ain't one of them... top kids'
         director plugs his latest dino-tedium in THE RETURN OF
         STEVEN SPIELBERG (2.20pm, Sun, BBC2) then intros a (frankly
         funnier) sequel, BACK TO THE FUTURE PART II (2.50pm, Sun,
         BBC2)... THE WORKS (8.55pm, Sun, BBC2) double-bills Arthur
         C Clarke with yet another weird sci-fi edition of THE OUTER
         LIMITS (9.25pm, Sun, BBC2)... NEIGHBOURS FROM HELL (9pm,
         Mon, ITV) provide the latest in nightmarish camcorder docu-
         drama entertainment... Stewart Brand patronises the
         creativity of the poorly housed in HOW BUILDINGS LEARN
         (7.30pm, BBC2, Thu) so, instead, be sure to tape those new
         rendering gimmicks in the third series of deeply fantastic
         CGI cartoon REBOOT (4.40pm, Thu, ITV)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES &gt;&gt; SWINGERS (no-one you've heard of) is low-budget,
         fast-talking blokes hanging round in bars and failing to
         chat up women, and apparently completely brilliant...
         UNFORGETTABLE (Ray Liotta, Linda Fiorentino) sees John "The
         Last Seduction" Dahl re-teaming with Fiorentino to mangle
         an over-complicated memory-transplant murder plot...
         deviant Londoners can enjoy the NFT's short-but-vivid DAVID
         CRONENBERG season (all July); we say go for the crazed
         Canuck's early, funny films (Shivers, Videodrome) rather
         than the arty stuff (Rabid, The Brood)...

         cybermag published by stuffy academic press Gordon + Breach
         has reached our shores: contents in #23 include the Gibson-
         Sterling hybrid praising John Shirley plus Prions, Cancer,
         NASA and Mark Dery choking back his pessimism long enough
         to interview Vernor Vinge... CINEFEX #70, the goddam sexy
         film FX mag is (briefly) on shelves of the specialist shops
         - features on NTK fave The Fifth Element, Men in Black, and
         some dino flick... FILM THREAT has got money troubles and
         has suspended publication until they're sorted out,
         publisher CHRIS GORE weeps. Going "subscription only" a
         couple of months back was maybe a strong hint: check
         <a href="http://www.filmthreat.com">www.filmthreat.com</a> for details... meanwhile, SCI-FI
         UNIVERSE, Gore's moneyspinner for ex-employers IDG
         Publications, has been sold to the coincidentally-named
         SCI-FI CHANNEL... and in final act of media injustice,
         funny, moral San Fran mag MIGHT MAGAZINE is no more.
         Unless, that is, the hints in the "Are Black People Cooler
         Than White People?" issue are *another* prank...
