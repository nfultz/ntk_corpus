</span><span class="item">         Good to see somebody's taking that stooge of the Conspiracy,
         the FORTEAN TIMES, seriously. We've somewhat lost track of
         the internecine battles between the UK anarchist factions
         that led up to this, but it appears that GREEN ANARCHIST
         (Affiliation: Radical ALF caucus. Likes: direct action,
         Oxford pubs, dislikes: Special Branch raids) are still very
         miffed at STEWART HOME (Neoist Alliance. Likes: his own
         "shopping, fucking, fermenting proletarian revolt" novels,
         dislikes: not being noticed). To the point where, on hearing 
         that Home will be speaking at the notoriously light-hearted 
         Unconvention, GA has decided to picket the con. And lest 
         anyone doubt the seriousness of the FT's threat to the 
         ecological struggle, GA add that "This protest is part of 
         a general struggle against the activities and influence of 
         the secret state... Hepple [a UFOlogist who GA believes is a 
         'state-sponsored infiltrator'] is pushing a Nazi saucers 
         thesis, and Home is part of a general state attempt to 
         disorientate people by branding anarchists the same thing 
         as fascists." Well, the disorientation bit seems to be 
         working: we're still unsure whether this is just another 
         Home plot to up his cred amongst the three people who still 
         care. We do however, admire the Unconvention's own response 
         to the picket. They're planning on joining it, and will be 
         taking time out from organising the event to pop outside and 
         demand that they should be shut down as enemies of the people. 
         Oh, this should be *fun*.

</span><span class="item">         If CURADOR, the "other" Welsh hacker, really had snagged Bill
         Gates' credit card details, you just know that he'd be in Rio 
         by now, rather than merely on bail in his home town of
         Clynderwen. Still, that didn't stop the Telegraph from reporting 
         his boast as human interest after his bust, then Reuters taking 
         it as read, then the whole world running the story untainted by 
         fact-checking. Fact checking, like: the alleged credit card had 
         the wrong number of digits. Or that Bill got his middle initial 
         wrong. Or that he spelt his company "microsfot". And we're left 
         wondering who, exactly, comes out looking stupider here: 
         Curador, for crowing about his ph33rsom skills and getting busted, 
         the media for stoking up the sad story - or the FBI, for 
         travelling 6000 miles to nab yet another script kiddy for their 
         quotas?

         certainly not powered by clue. Example no. 94: AMSTRAD finally 
         announced their thin Net client, and it turns out to be thinner
         than anyone could have dreamed. A souped-up fax machine that 
         can't browse, and, in this age of free dial-ups costs you 
         UKP UKP UKP per e-mail you send. Still, at least it can cope 
         with GIF attachments - tapping into that lucrative monochrome 
         CCITT porn market. But even if the thing is clearly as dead as 
         an Acorn NetStation, that didn't stop Amstrad stocks sextupling

</span><span class="item">         Multiple partitions ahoy! While you're trying to work out
         what to do with the new, free, Be 5 ("did we say we made
         money from our OS? Non, non, non! Je suis un internet
         appliance partner!"), why not waste more premature bandwidth
         on Perl 5.6, which at least has a chance of not breaking
         everything you depend upon? The new version is dripping with
         features we're not going to understand until the next Camel
         book comes out, but to give you a taste: forking for
         Windows, Unicode support (kinda), 64-bit support (kinda),
         that whole sick code-in-a-regexp functionality,
         "autovivifying file handles", a matching set of new
         warnings and errors (including a "Y2K warning" whenever you
         do something odd with the number 19), and, apparently about
         15% slower than the last one. Our favourite feature:
         not only has the version numbering system changed to a
         "v5.6.x" format, the Perlporters have introduced a special
         pseudo-type to support such version numbers, right damn well
         into the freaking language. Sauron's work, I tell you.

         from the new series, or this new solo run of DA ALI G SHOW 
         (10.30pm, Fri, C4) is shit... DV-camcorder docu THE OTHER SIDE

         so-called 'cos of all the pale white guys who, every year, 
         forget their sunblock... while Shannon Doherty sub-Buffy 
         witchery CHARMED (8.05pm, Sat, C5) appears to be an unofficial 
         spin-off of the movie "The Craft", right down to featuring 
         that same Psychedelic Furs cover of The Smiths... Harry Hill 
         tries to put a new spin on the old "Nil points" gags in the 
         Eurovision TOP TEN (8.55pm, Sat, C4) - though wasn't there 
         some overlap between last week's "Novelty" hits and the 
         previous "One Hit Wonders"?... we're still convinced that the 
         famous "Monsters from the Id" speech in FORBIDDEN PLANET 
         (3.20pm, Sun, C4) is a prescient description of the internet 
         (or possibly, Quake servers)... and supposed Michael Barrymore 
         Larry Sanders-style vehicle BOB MARTIN (10pm, Sun, ITV) in

         With Medinner" Mills' dire previous stab at the genre, "The

         Sanders-like euphony between "Bob Mills" and "Bob Martin"...

         "experimental standards" - IP via avian carriers (RFC1149),

         who writes the "Bookworm on the Internet" column for The 
         Bookseller (and was once described to us, in tribute to the 
         former Time Out net columnist, as "the new Spyder"), quite 
         appropriately bemoans her "6th or 7th unsubscribe attempt" 
         from lastminute.com, but then goes and spoils it all with: 
         "Perhaps I missed something when NTK started up, but I feel it 
         would be easier to read your amusing comments if they were 
         arranged in conventional lines. Agreed, content is king, but 
         not all your readers have twentysomething eyesight." Damn, 
         you're right, Anne (if you can read this at all) - no wonder 
         those pesky dead tree media have proved so devilishly hard to 
         finish off... re: NTK 2003-03-17, "What do you have against

         never know... and, finally, previous Cinergy host and "The 
         Word" presenter ALAN CONNOR (then HAMILTON?) picked up both 
         the "teenage crushes" thread [NTK 2000-03-10] and our general 
         interest in celebrity nudity, and wove them into a charming 
         tale describing his "confused feelings" on discovering

         have directed us to this assiduous collator of the Splendor 
         that is Woman once before," Alan graciously conceded, before 
         spontaneously offering no less than *two* disclaimers: "1. 
         I came across these sites while trying to find about Jayne 
         Ashbourne's performance in Troilus and Cressida" and "2. And  
         I was using Lynx, so I have no idea what the soft-porn shots 
         with Dalek look like." Bad news Alan - most of the GIFs are 
         broken. The frustration continues...
