</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         People come up to us and ask: why have you never diversified
         into a recruitment site, precisely targetted at the
         creme-de-creme of the technology sector? Which reminds us:
         must buy more quicklime for the cellar. Anyway, the two
         reasons are this: firstly, if a tolerable tech job does turn
         up, we run it as a headline story, because God knows it's
         news to most of us. Case in point: THE FOUNDATION FOR
         INFORMATION POLICY RESEARCH, those nice people who
         marshalled the anti-RIP forces, are currently working on
         fighting Clause 59 of the Health and Social Care Bill. This
         one would allow the Health Secretary to pass on your medical
         details to *anyone* - bypassing any medical assurances of
         privacy - provided they deem it "expedient" to do so. FIPR
         is looking for someone to help run the website for this -
         and quick, because it's already past committee stage, and on
         its way to becoming law. Money may change hands: mail
</span><span class="trailing_urls">         <a href="mailto:cb@fipr.org">cb@fipr.org</a> for more details. Yes, that does count as
         interesting. And secondly, if we *did* run a recruitment
         site, we're almost positive it would end up like this:
         <a href="http://www.recruitfree.com/">http://www.recruitfree.com/</a>
      - the going rate for Arse Photographer is much higher than that
         <a href="http://194.128.65.4/pa/cm200001/cmbills/009/01009--l.htm#59">http://194.128.65.4/pa/cm200001/cmbills/009/01009--l.htm#59</a>
                           - look, what did we tell you? fascinating!
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         You know what would be a great VB worm? One that rifled
         through your Outlook address book, mailmerged all the local
         names into the traditional wide-ranging abusive resignation
         note, then sent it out to <a href="mailto:all@yourcompany.co.uk.">all@yourcompany.co.uk.</a> God knows
         we've got an excellent template from a recent suicide note
         at NOHO. You'll remember them, we're sure, as the
         "interactive" company featured in The Net's "day in the
         dotcom life" back in the twentieth, only to be eaten alive
         by ad agency Ogilvy. Off the top of our heads, then, our
         letter might go: "$BOSS1 - quite frankly, you have to take
         responsibility for this circus ... and the all round clicky
         'you only get something in this company if you lick the
         right arse as opposed to having the right skill' heritage
         that has come over from $BIGMERGERCOMPANY. $BOSS2 - you
         really are a prick. $COLLEAGUE - how the fuck you made
         $RESPONSIBLEPOSITION I don't know, but it must have made
         your arse sore. $SALES1 - you really are an arrogant
         bastard." And so on it goes, and so on, until the worm ends,
         or turns, or just goes off to work for a nice, sane, likkle
         company and the big corps finally explode from their own
         smarmy incompetence.

         their popularity - U2 being another current example - their

         of more intimate club-style venues, including THE GARAGE,

         RUBBERHOSE, his fine two-year-old toddler of a "deniable
         encryption" system. In Assange's own sweet, twisted way,
         Rubberhose is named after the decryption tactic it attempts
         to defeat: Rubberhose Cryptanalysis, in which suspects are
         exposed to repeated rounds of the "kick to the head" attack
         until their password is revealed. Rubberhose thwarts this by
         allowing a large number of encrypted messages to be stored
         on the same drive, each encoded with a different password.
         The total number of levels is unknown, so when Commandante
         Plodista requests your passphrase, you can happily give him
         the password to the lowest level (or three), confident that
         noone can ever prove that this isn't *all* the data you have
         on the drive. Along with StegFS, it's another recommended
         RIP-bypasser. Unless you really are under risk of being
         beaten up, in which case, we'll re-pose the FAQ: won't
         rational torturers just beat you up *forever*? Anyone want
         to pick up on the in-the-field research here?

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; RIGHT TO REPLY (7.30pm, Fri, C4) returns to offer some
         kind of freakish edutainment during the bands you don't want
         to watch on "Top Of The Pops" - though, on next week's show,
         Warren "Transmetropolitan" Ellis and some guy from NTK mount
         an entirely justified attack on Sky's "Dark Angel"... NTK's
         emeritus Kinder Egg expert Mark Pawson guests in breakfast
         bonanza I LOVE CEREAL (2.35am, Fri, C4)... and I LOVE 1983
         (9.05pm, Sat, BBC2) pays long-overdue homage to Knight Rider,
         Roland Rat, and He-Man And Masters Of The Universe... Ken
         "Altered States" Russell pioneers web-based movie distribution
         (by making one, rather than developing compression codecs) in
         his garage on THE SOUTH BANK SHOW (10.45pm, Sun, ITV)... Steve
         Buscemi fails to shake off that weaselly slacker typecasting
         in his directorial debut TREES LOUNGE (11pm, Sun, BBC2)... and
         C4 fields the bizarrely themed THE REAL SPARTACUS (9pm, Mon,
         C4), UP POMPEII (10pm, Mon, C4) and the psychotherapy spoof
         episode of ANGEL (11.45pm, Mon, C4) against C5 category-killer
         THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS (10pm, Mon, C5)... before going head-
         to-head again on Weds, with C4's regular cross-dressing sex
         strand vs tiresome Geena Davis Total-Recall-ripoff THE LONG
         KISS GOODNIGHT (9pm, Tue, C5)... a rerun from the start of THE
         NEW ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN (6pm, Thu, BBC2) provides a timely
         reminder of what Dean Kamen was best known for before all that
         Ginger scooter business... DISINFO NATION (1am, Thu, C4) talks
         again with Howard Bloom - boggle-eyed evolution loon... while
         HORIZON (9pm, Thu, BBC2) profiles a Parkinson's disease
         sufferer who's stimulated by taking Ecstacy - next week:
         amazing revelations about the soothing pain-killing properties
         of heroin and cocaine...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; essentially it's the story of our pre-NTK lives, but
         with rock music instead of technology, and Lester Bangs
         instead of Rupert Goodwins - so we were already biased towards
         junior-journalist Spinal-Tap-meets-Jerry-Maguire man-weepie
         ALMOST FAMOUS (<a href="http://www.cndb.com">http://www.cndb.com</a> : the nudity, even though
         it's really brief, is great [...] [Kate] Hudson spins around
         and her fur coat opens up and [...] her excellent, perky nubs
         are flashed [...] can't wait for the DVD)... otherwise, with
         the possible exception of what appear to be special advance
         previews of the actionless HANNIBAL (imdb: sequel / fbi /
         cannibal / revenge / serial-killer / carousel), it's a
         reassuringly homoerotic Valentine-week selection, with Boaz
         "Fresh" Yakin's 1970s antiracist gridiron feelgooder REMEMBER
         THE TITANS (<a href="http://www.capalert.com">http://www.capalert.com</a> : lying to encourage
         performance; vehicular stupidity; homosexual kiss; numerous
         homosexual presences and innuendo) - a title which is funnier
         in the US where "Titan" is a popular brand of condoms... "a
         movie version of 'That '70s Show' - yet still worse than you'd
         expect" largely sums up ree-tarded stoner buddy atrocity DUDE,
         WHERE'S MY CAR (<a href="http://www.capalert.com">http://www.capalert.com</a> : dog smoking dope;
         adult urinating on a house plant twice; homosexual licking
         kissing between Jesse and the transvestite stripper; crude
         uses of a variation of the name of the planet Uranus)... which
         leaves platonic pair (and recipients of 4 stars in this
         month's SFX magazine, for "acknowledging their lameness", or
         something) ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE (imdb: Rene "Freejack" Russo,
         Jason "Seinfeld" Alexander, Piper "Coyote Ugly" Perabo, Randy
         "ID4" Quaid, Janeane "Larry Sanders Show" Garofalo, Robert De
         "Meet The Parents" Niro - together at last!)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         HOT FOOD ACTION&gt;&gt; in the US, the Superbowl heralded the launch
         of the SNICKERS CRUNCHER ("Crisped Rice, Crunchy Peanuts, And
         Caramel In Delicious Milk Chocolate") but, over here, we have
         to make do with KELLOGG'S REAL FRUIT WINDERS (29p), and their
         improbably bold invitation to "unwind the fruit fun forever!".
         "[They're] essentially Rowntree's fruit gums that have been
         run over by a steamroller, stretched onto a long strip of
         greaseproof paper," noted WAYNE WILLIAMS. "Quite nice, but
         decidedly odd." Available in 3 flavours (Orange, Strawberry
         and Blackcurrant - but no "Wavey Davey"), though the "real
         fruit" appears to be 45% pear in all of them... not much new
         confectionery-wise, what with upmarket "Milk And Hazelnuts"
         disappointment KINDER BUENO (45p), and the news that NESTLE
         TOFFEE CRISP COCONUT (28p) *is* becoming a permanent extension
         to the line. We eagerly await your sightings of bite-sized
         MARS BOUNTY CALAPUNO (UKP1.79 for box of 15) and crispy US
         imports GOLDEN WONDER/ GENERAL MILLS CORN BUGLES (27p) and
         WALKERS FUNYUNS (27p) - still outselling "Responsibilityuns"

         worldwide... take it from us, the real heat in the market
         right now is coming from (or being directed at) the warm-it-
         yourself sector, with FOX'S SOME LIKE IT HOT BISCUITS (99p for
         6) venturing into the soft-cookie territory that was formerly
         OTIS SPUNKMEYER's near-exclusive domain. Varieties include
         "Chunky Chocolate", "Raspberry And White Chocolate", and the
         surprising stand-out for us, "Toffee And Apple" - owners of
         high-powered modern microwaves *must* heed the maximum 13
         seconds cooking time (no matter how many you've put in), or
         they spectacularly incinerate themselves in protest... also
         pleasingly microwaveable (though they don't tell you that on
         the packaging) is BIRDS EYE'S "ENJOY" range of ready meals for
         connoisseurs (from around UKP1.99), including an exquisite
         "Thai Chicken Rice" (UKP2.99)... disappointingly, we've seen
         no especially freakish Valentine's tie-ins this year [see NTKs
         2000-02-11, 1999-02-12], though we have high hopes for CHEF'S
         LOVE SAUSAGE and CHEF'S MEATY BALLS, both part of the SOUTH
         PARK CHEF'S PREMIUM COLLECTION. And MCDONALDS have, to their
         credit, made some sort of effort, offering a "free Rolo" on
         Feb 14th (while stocks last) to purchasers of the Burger-King-
         esque MOZZARELLA MCDOUBLE (UKP1.39), some tediously Italian-
         themed MCCHICKEN SANDWICH (UKP1.99), the same-as-a-normal-
         chocolate McFlurry-but-with-coffee-sauce-on-it CAPPUCCINO
         MCFLURRY (99p), and the revolting MELTING CHEESE HEARTS WITH
         SPICY TOMATO DIP, seemingly the product of re-tooled Chicken
         McNugget technology. Yes, we are aware that these are among
         the most cynically depressing foodstuffs that we've ever
         covered. But, hey, free Rolo!...
