</span><span class="item">          The BBC, The Register, New Scientist and all fell over
          themselves this week to promote "NannieBots", a set of
          "self-replicating" bots to fight chatroom "grooming". These
          bots, relays their master Jim Wightman, guard kids'
          chatrooms from predators, and "behave like humans, sound
          like humans... but with one massive difference - they never
          sleep". The idea of handing over your kids' safety to Eliza
          the Psychiatrist may not be that reassuring. But don't worry
          - these bots use "neural networks" to become "the most
          advanced artificial intelligence in the world"! Looking
          through the transcript of a NannieBot/Human interaction in
          New Scientist, maybe he's right. Certainly this "IT
          consultant from Wolverhampton in the West Midlands" has
          either managed the greatest step forward in Artificial
          Intelligence since Marvin Minsky scraped a pass in the
          Turing Test - or this was a very carefully rigged demo. In
          the transcript given, NannieBot seems to be able to make
          logical deductions, parse colloquial English, correctly
          choose the correct moment to scan a database of UK national
          holidays, comment on the relative qualities of the Robocop
          series, and divine the nature of pancakes and pancake day.
          We look forward to the NannieBot sweeping the board at this
          year's Loebner Prize. Either that, or journalists to stop
          suspending their disbelief whenever someone starts waving 
          a paedophile on a string.

          fundraiser MySociety have at last addressed their "not actually
          having any money" hindrance by scoring a cool UKP250,000 from
          the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's "e-Innovations" 
          initiative this week. That means that the five projects you
          may have argued for look like they could be funded to
          completion. The money *is* trickling down through the filter
          of a West Sussex County Council partnership, which may make
          things more complex (for instance, as well as the MySociety
          projects, the money will go on "a centre of excellence for
          the continued development and maintenance of community
          engagement online solutions" - although that could just be
          govtalk for a wiki). Whatever - it's got to be better than
          the half-a-teabreak EDS would have spent the government cash
          on. Also interesting are the other initiatives that got
          spondoolicks: a wifi network for CCTV's in Westminster (500K
          UKP), Rossendale, Lancs' stab at moving to open source
          software (500K UKP), and a Newham project to create an open
          source implementation of TV over IP (460K UKP). Looking
          forward to seeing the meta-hacks for those babies.

         here's another way you might get a whiff of all that public 
         cash kicking around - West Sussex's FUTURE SOMETHING PROJECT 
         is looking for 4 new media-ish freelancers to lead small teams 
         of "at risk" young people in the design of, well, presumably 
         something "futuristic" over the next 10 months. Your 
         availability would need to be 2 days/week for a total of 80-90 
         days, at a daily rate of UKP200 - but you'd need to email 
         <a href="mailto:andy@artswork.demon.co.uk">andy@artswork.demon.co.uk</a> with a "1-2 page proposal of 
         interest and a current CV/ examples of work" pretty fast, as 
         the deadline for applications is midnight next Tue March 23rd. 
         There's a bit more info on the site - but not too much on just 
         what sort of "Future Something" they've got in mind, so feel 
         free to borrow our off-the-cuff ideas of: that one-hit wonder 
         band who did "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (Deep Blue Something), a 
         Bananarama-based speech synth (Really Saying Something), or 
         that DR and Quinch episode with the illegible movie script

         Fri)... "The Dice Man"-inspired DICE LIFE (6.15pm, Sat, C4) 
         isn't quite the randomly generated dance musical you were 
         hoping for... while BATTLE STATIONS (7.15pm, Sat, C4) will 
         hopefully attribute the F-15's "unbeaten" record to it not 
         having been up against many Su-35s... Heather Locklear - heck, 
         even William Shatner - look so young in TJ HOOKER (2.45pm, 
         Sun, C5), part of Five's retro day that, in the form of the 
         surprisingly competent CHARLIE'S ANGELS (8pm, Sun, C5), reminds 
         you just how long it's been since The Prodigy released "The 
         Fat Of The Land"... and, as we always say, nice touch getting 
         Chef from "South Park" to sing the theme to '70s remake SHAFT 
         (10pm, Sun, C4)... those "Dawson's Creek" kids just can't help 
         running into trouble in the likes of URBAN LEGEND (11pm, Mon, 
         C4) and DISTURBING BEHAVIOUR (11.35pm, Tue, BBC1)... cameras 
         were intriguingly on hand for the Operation Ore arrest of Pete 
         Townshend, reveals POLICE PROTECTING CHILDREN (9pm, Tue, BBC2) 
         ... it's Cadbury vs Nestle in the last in this series of FAT 
         PROFITS (7.30pm, Wed, BBC2)... and reader JOHN "Circlemakers" 
         LUNDBERG *says* his film THE MYTHOLOGIST (10.40pm, Thu, BBC4) 
         is about Nottingham shop assistant turned paranormal

         slightly hit-and-miss Wilson/ Stiller schtick still gets you 
         through semi-reverential 1970s homage STARSKY AND HUTCH 
         ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/starskyandhutch.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/starskyandhutch.htm</a> :

         Elektra]... engage in lesbian kissing; lunacy with a firearm) 
         ... according to this lucid piece of imdb.com trivia, "It is 
         impossible to actually steal a copy of the SATs because there 
         are several versions. Everyone who takes it has different 
         questions or the questions are in a different order" - much to 
         the surprise of tame high-school exam caper THE PERFECT SCORE

         Kitano's uninspired samurai-er ZATOICHI (imdb: jidai-geki/ 
         killing/ tap-dance/ based-on-novel)... or Johnny Knoxville 
         muso romp GRAND THEFT PARSONS ( <a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/">http://www.bbfc.co.uk/</a> :

         currently on sale at <a href="http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/">http://www.ntkmart.co.uk/</a> , along with 
         our first ever music-merchandising tie-in, the complete lyrics 
         to MJ HIBBETT's low-tech toe-tapper "Hey Hey 16K" ("We bought 
         it to help with your homework/ And the household accounts/ If 
         your dad ever works it all out", and so forth). Plus there are 
         half-price bargains to be had on the last ever stocks (hot 
         from that exhibition in Sheffield) of the old designs that say 
         "If I Had A Life I Wouldn't Be Here", the complicated "The 
         Internet is like" Google search one, plus "NTK - They Stole 
         Our Revolution, Now We're Stealing It Back"... MJ Hibbett and 
         NoneMoreNegative both get 2 quid for each of their shirts 
         sold, and you could be joining them if you mail in any design 
         suggestions of the general level of obscurity of, say, SIMON 
         WISTOW's slogans "Dorothy Parker would use a Mac", "High 
         Functioning Autist", or his somewhat more graphic "attempt to 
         fan the flames of a nascent anti-social software movement":

         - but most other recent submissions have been rather more 
         conceptual, including JONAS BN's "If the world was run by DBAs 
         would we all be related?", LEE MAGUIRE's "An Atari logo with 
         middle 'spike' removed, or altered with lettering in Atari 
         font [to say] MANTITI", plus EDMUND GRIMLEY EVANS' "Do you do

         that he saw "a rather clever chap making his own films using

         Hancock) trying to play our "Buy One, Subvert The Mass Media, 
         Get One Free" contest on Bravo's GamePad 4, but the only other 
         action there has been NTK's own "Dave Green" sneaking an 
         AD/HD shirt onto page 56 of last month's issue of "The Face" 
         (cover line: "The World's Most Beautiful Woman Meets Fashion's 
         Greatest Maverick"), an incident which appears to have 
         constituted "the final straw" for that particular magazine:
