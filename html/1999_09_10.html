</span><span class="item">         NORWEB finally plonked their Net-over-mains-cables into the
         electric chair this week, citing problems finding either
         customers or investors for the innovative, plucky, British
         technology. The decision to kill the tech was, we're sure,
         completely unrelated to that whole "streetlamps dumping
         cartloads of RF interference" rumour that we - and New
         Scientist, and the Institute of Electrical Engineers - so
         callously spread back when they were being hailed as the new
         Edisons of the broadband revolution. Nonetheless - FALCO!

</span><span class="item">         At least we've got that ADSL rollout to look forward to,
         right? Yeah, well - despite all our fondest hopes, the law
         of lowered expectations is ruling this story too. Several
         ISPs have pointed out to us that BT's pricing of
         40UKP-150UKP for the average home user doesn't quite add up.
         The wholesale price list for an ADSL link works out at
         around 160UKP per person for service providers. The service
         in question is called "IPstream Business" - despite being
         the bog-standard dynamic IP ADSL setup connection. Which
         begs the question, where's the cheapo consumer version gone?
         Could it be that those anti-ADSL forces within BT are have
         stopped a general roll-out until they can work out a way of
         sneaking more money from the punters? And would that explain
         why BT's ADSL triallists (whose trial was supposed to end
         weeks ago) are being sent Mondex cards to play with? Do we
         sniff a technology tie-in? Or even a technology lock-in?

         planning this for some time. Which, given DNScon put out the

         I-Ching interpretation. But Perl users are nothing if not
         resourceful in religious battle. Turning their own weakness
         into a strength, the Coy.pm CPAN Perl module intercepts
         error messages and dynamically prefixes a calming haiku, to
         counteract any karmic damage. Expect a kill-at-a-distance
         XML-RPC module any day soon.

         Twin collaborator - and future Neuromancer director? - Chris
         Cunningham... Saturday night movie romps include OK-ish
         Woody Allen divorce-whine HUSBANDS AND WIVES (11pm, Sat,
         BBC2), "Springtime For Hitler" Mel Brooks farce THE
         PRODUCERS (12.45am, Sat, BBC2), Stallone/ Bullock sci-fi
         satire DEMOLITION MAN (10.20pm, Sat, ITV), plus '70s Hammer
         proto-Ghostbusters THE ASPHYX (12.30am, Sat, BBC1) - last
         shown almost exactly one year ago (give or take a month or
         two)... and if you're watching Graham Norton's 100 GREATEST
         TV MOMENTS (9pm, Sat, C4) and they all seem to be
         ultra-recent catchphrase comedy skits, then you've
         accidentally tuned to BBC2's FAST SHOW NIGHT instead (from
         9pm, Sat, BBC2)... don't know if this is deliberate, but
         everyone says the ELVIS 1968 COMEBACK SPECIAL (11.50pm, Sun,
         C4) is, indeed, a milestone in TV pop history... Jonny Lee
         "Hackers" Miller heads up confusingly poetic WW1 Dr Who
         spin-off REGENERATION (10pm, Sun, BBC2)... and, as if last
         week's Mark "TV's The Crow" Dacascos cyber kung-fu
         beat-em-up wasn't enough like The Matrix, this week's one -
         SABOTAGE (9pm, Tue, C5) - even has Carrie-Anne "Trinity"
         Moss in it...

         but then you type "Eyes Wide *Shit*" instead? Well, you were
         right the first time - phenomenally dull plot-free ramblings
         of interest only to connoisseurs of semi-nude Kylie
         lookalikes. Kubrick probably died of shame but, hey, that

         batch of free CDs belong in the supermarket: we're not quite 
         sure who CROSSE AND BLACKWELL's SNACK STOP "Taste Of The 
         UK Music Scene" disc is aimed at (UKP1.25 twin pack) - 
         having lulled you with oldies from Cast, Ocean Colour 
         Scene, Lighthouse Family and Shed Seven, it ups the tempo 
         with System F's friendly hard-trance MP3 fave "Out Of The 
         Blue"... still, at least the track listing's visible, 
         unlike NESTLE GOLDEN GRAHAMS' optimistic "Best Album Of The 
         Next Century Ever" (pts 1 and 2, UKP 1.79). #2 (the blue 
         one) has a slight edge (as with all 3 CDs, &lt;30 min running 
         time); an intriguing compilation of slipstream future rock, 
         largely from bands with one-word names - Space, Antenna, 
         Trippa, Serum, Cable, Cuba, and Muse... oh, and the new 
         issue of ARCADE magazine covermounts a Wipeout 3 megamix 
         soundtrack CD, again only 30 minutes long... now even 
         Puff Daddy's covered "Public Enemy No 1", is the world 
         ready for a PUBLIC ENEMY tribute album, featuring that, 
         Anthrax's "Bring The Noise", and - of course - Tricky's 
         "Black Steel (In The Hour Of Chaos)"?... soundalike dept: a 
         nameless tipster claims that S-CLUB 7's second single 
         (tantalisingly named "S-Club Party", we believe) bears some 
         resemblance to the Spice Girls' second single, "Say You'll 
         Be There"; DOM "THE DOMINATOR" MCCLANE reports that the 
         chorus of CAPRICE's "Oh Yeah" seems like it's about to lead 
         into the chorus of "Bugs" by HEPBURN (a problem we have 
         with that "Abercrombie and Fitch" song and Bran Van 3000); 
         and, if you can tear yourself away from her appalling "bad 
         girl" acting in the video, scientists confirm that you 
         *can* sing "Addicted To Love" over SPORTY MEL C's "Going 
         Down"... and finally, we note that, even after winning last 
         night's "Viewer's Choice" MTV Video Award, those cheeky 
         BACKSTREET BOYS have failed to provide any consistent 
         lyrical interpretation of their "I Want It That Way" 
         megahit, fuelling persistent net speculation that it 
         "might be about anal sex"...
