</span><span class="item">         Andrew Simmons - or John Doe #13 as he's known to the DVD
         CCA - still has his DEMON INTERNET site untouched by the
         long arm of the Movie Industry police: but reports that
         other Demon subscribers have felt the hot-breath of Jack
         Valenti on their neck. This month, the MPAA's lawyers sent
         out a threatening legal letter to Thus, demanding that an
         unnamed subscriber's DeCSS mirror be smashed - and for a few
         moments it looked like the litigation-shy ISP was going to
         capitulate. Provide proof that you have permission to
         publish the material within five days, roiled the standard
         e-mail, or lose your site. Well, ahem, replied the customer:
         please note that a) DeCSS is as public domain as you can
         get, b) those scary statues the MPAA cite all appear to have
         the giveaway "U.S." at the beginning of them, and c) I'm a
         founding Demon subscriber, you ungrateful curs. Demon didn't
         take it further; we hope that this acts as a hint to any
         future ISPs who might get fidgety under the MPAA's gaze. If
         Demon hasn't nodded yet, maybe you don't have to either.

</span><span class="item">         BRITISH TELECOM, ever happy to be in accordance with
         prophecy [NTK 1999-07-09] continue to mope over that local 
         loop unbundling, muttering that nobody's allowed in until 
         the rooms are tidier. Especially, as it turns out, the more
         lucrative (sorry, "crowded") exchanges. Before you can bring
         your mucky feet in here, reports BBC News' Mark Ward, BT are
         demanding extra 17,200 sq metres of anti-static vinyl
         flooring, 2,500 smoke detectors, 1,700 "kickproof" security
         doors, and somebody to clear up all the porn mags that are
         lying around. Co-locating in BT's exchanges is turning out
         to be like some student flat-share from hell: a feeling now
         confirmed by the telco's suggestion that fights over who
         gets the best rooms be sorted out by a Single Transferable
         Vote system, which BT apparently studied last term in
         Politics. This system ends up with BT throwing dice to sort
         out deadlocks. And what's wrong with a good old game of Spin
         the Bottle, then?

</span><span class="item">         Sadly, it's too late for such shenanigans to affect one cut-
         throat competition, as Demon, Pipex and CIX fight it out for 
         the "Best Business ISP" accolade at the first-ever UK NET 
         AWARDS (next Thu 2000-09-28, Natural History Museum), the 
         latest embarrassing attempt by FUTURE PUBLISHING, sorry, THE 
         FUTURE NETWORK to rebrand itself as an exciting new-media 
         company. Rivalling even the Yell Awards for "Dullest Web Line-
         Up Of The Year", the categories alone make hilarious reading: 
         "E-Company of the Year. For the company that shows the best 
         understanding of the new economy and the rules of business in 
         the 21st century. Nominees: The Easy Group, Virgin, Egg". 
         Still, it's good to see that the 6 (out of 17) category 
         sponsors which, 10 days ago, remained "to be confirmed" have 
         now been revealed as none other than: .Net, Internet Works,

</span><span class="item">         Grapple-hooking into the office at midnight to fix the
         broken Linux box before management realises it's now running
         the entire business? Only room in the catsuit for the *one*
         floppy? Yeah, us too: and since that unpleasantness last
         time, we're sticking to the simple, useful, mildly cooler
         TOM'S ROOT BOOT Linux-on-a-3-and-a-halfshell. Oh sure,
         you've got your fancier picoLinuxen and your Linux Router
         Project derivatives elsewhere, but only Tom's distribution
         manages to combine a 2.0.37 kernel, network card mods,
         pcmcia, ftp/wget'ish downloader, and more rescue utils than
         you really want to think about right now. And if you need
         anything else, Tom's root boot is almost elementary to
         unravel and knit with your own additions. Now, all we need
         is some way to get past the laser sensor array.

         flooding in for our innovative help-NTK-design-its-own-
         merchandise competition, which is hugely reassuring seeing as 
         we've yet to finalise the rules/ royalty scheme/ closing date 
         or any annoying details like that. Perhaps inspired by the 
         open-source efforts of <a href="http://geekshirts.sourceforge.net/">http://geekshirts.sourceforge.net/</a> , 
         GARY CARROLL queried our original "we'll sell the best ones 
         and give the designers some of the money" plan, suggesting 
         "How's about making the designs available as jpegs and letting 
         [us] print our own T-shirts using our cute little inkjet 
         printers, thereby promoting NTK's twisted truth seeking with 
         reduced expense and contribution to global capitalism?" Well 
         Gary, that option will be entirely up to the individual 
         winning designers (apparently people get quite excited about 
         being told they *have* to open source their stuff nowadays)... 
         in other intellectual property news, we're still negotiating 
         with the vast "Zeppotron" media conglomerate over whether you 
         can use "TVGoHome" concepts and/or characters, like the "I'm 
         With Nathan Barley" entry from <a href="http://www.growf.org/shirts/">http://www.growf.org/shirts/</a> , 
         though you should get away with obvious bastardisations of, 
         say, the NTL logo - <a href="http://www.bhikku.co.uk/shirt.htm">http://www.bhikku.co.uk/shirt.htm</a> , for 
         instance. Bold irreverence towards NTK itself is encouraged, 
         as in <a href="http://www.mitt.demon.co.uk/tshirt/satyre.png">http://www.mitt.demon.co.uk/tshirt/satyre.png</a> (from 
         JAMES "MOOSE" BROWN, increasingly believed to be the anonymous 
         swearing-obsessed plaintiff from last week's issue), though 
         reliance on yet-to-be-devised printing technologies may hinder 
         your application: <a href="http://tv.cream.org/gorilla/ntkt/">http://tv.cream.org/gorilla/ntkt/</a> ... and, 
         finally, attempting to divine the assumed rulebase from all 
         the other entries you've sent in, it appears that you *can* 
         simply submit a text slogan - the most notable so far being 
         the succinct "British E-commerce: R.I.P.", from someone who 
         knows a thing or two about futuristic capitalism, IAN "ELITE" 
         BELL - although please make sure you mark your entry "T-shirt 
         Contest", so as to differentiate it from all the tips mail we 
         get from people unsuccessfully trying to unsubscribe, or 
         misunderstanding how the search box works. Keep 'em coming!...
