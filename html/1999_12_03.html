          period because you require a range of defences, moats,
          ramparts, portcullises, watch towers and alarms, guard dogs
          and blood hounds. Similarly you need a bespoke security
          architecture that can continually adapt to the rising

         Justice's rumoured plans for Microsoft - that BT be split
         into completely separate companies, but frankly, they're
         acting schizoid enough as it is. Good BT: The pricing for
         ADSL finally came through, and it's ohhh-kay. 150UKP connect
         fee, with a monthly cover of 30UKP charged to ISPs (boiling
         down to around 50UKP a month when you include ISP add-ons).
         Bad, *bad*, BT: Sir Iain Vallance, at a Brighton conference
         for telco managers, said that ADSL wasn't ready for the
         mainstream. Hell, he said the *Internet* wasn't ready for
         the mainstream: "in its infancy, and not yet fit for
         purpose", he said, adding that he felt like a "lollipop man
         restraining over-exuberant children." "The computing world has a very
         long way to go to match the standards of reliability and
         ease of access of broadcasting and fixed telecommunications
         worlds." Well, Iain, if you'd actually let them get on with it
         rather than standing in the middle of the road like an
         idiot, maybe we'd all get there a bit quicker.

         whois registry (to show registrars, not actual, useful,
         contact addresses) might break existing whois utilities. NSI
         protested that it wasn't their fault, and they were
         maintaining an old-style system at
         whois.networksolutions.com, which any sensible sysadmin could
         easily switch to. On the day of the switchover, NSI's own
         Web registration system broke. They were pointing to the
         wrong server. NTK would like to apologise for the apology.

         A NIGHT (Sat, from 21:00, C4) will cover the peculiar
         coincidence of Freddie Mercury dying at the same time as the
         UK release of Nightmare On Elm Street VI, resulting in
         cinemas across the country displaying celebratory "Freddie's
         Dead" posters (and who would have won that epic "Battle of
         the Dead Freddies", we wonder?)... C5 wheels out the
         original pilot movie of KNIGHT RIDER (Sun, 17:40pm, C5),
         which should at least clarify the bizarre "man who does not
         exist" voiceover at the start of each episode... and tedious
         anti-Japanese Michael Crichtoner RISING SUN (Sun, 22:00, C4)
         features Sean Connery as future saviour of humanity "John
         Connor"... Sue Lawley's CRIME SQUAD (Mon, 19:30, BBC1)
         continues inventing threats where none exist, in a seasonal
         round-up that includes bogus perfume street traders and "the
         trade in stolen Christmas trees" (believed to be worth
         billions every year, funding thousands of shed-based "chop
         shop" operations)... 1970s sub-Edge Of Darkness nuke
         eco-thriller DOOMWATCH (Tue, 21:00, C5) is revived on C5,
         now featuring Amanda Ooms, last seen changing into a
         werewolf in ITV's "Wilderness"...  TOTP2 (Wed, 18:00, BBC2)
         devotes 45 minutes to Shania Twain's two UK hits to date...
         while female RoboCop romp THE DEMOLITIONIST (Wed, 22:15, C5)

         Charge"...

         Man", David Lynch's hypnotically dull return-to-form OAP
         weepie THE STRAIGHT STORY (imdb: road) apparently gets its
         name because the mower the old guy is taking across America
         has a massive turning circle, meaning he has to drive it in
         a near-straight line through trailerparks, henhouses etc...
         further smalltown wackiness in pseudo-gay Steve "Reality
         Bites" Zahn, Jeremy "The Net" Northam stereotypical designer
         indie mistaken identity caper HAPPY TEXAS (imdb: comedy) -
         might be an improvement on the current glut of unremarkably
         worthy mother/ daughter movies, all of which seem to star
         Susan Sarandon... and finally, experts cite "2.4 Children"
         and "Allo Allo" among the sitcoms people would rather see
         made into movies than Rik Mayall/ Ade Edmondson's shamefully
         anachronistic "Bottom" and, in that arena alone, dire
         slapstick Fawlty Towers knock-off GUEST HOUSE PARADISO
         (BBFC: Theme: Comedy, hotel; Language: Occasional strong,
         some coarse; Sex: Frequent, moderate reference; Violence:
         Frequent, comic) fails to disappoint. Suffice to say, it's
         not the unofficial sequel to "Cinema Paradiso" that
         international audiences had been hoping for...

         rural Bedfordshire - no more than 20 or 30 muddy fields from
         the nearest rail station.  Nonetheless, there was a fair
         turnout of (clearly) dedicated individuals, mainly mourning
         the recent loss of both Spectrum tape-mag OUTLET and
         excellent Sinclair hacking zine THE ZX FILES, whose
         publisher has, in a search for even more obscurely rarified
