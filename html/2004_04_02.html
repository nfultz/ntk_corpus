</span><span class="item">         Thanks be to the radically distributed nature of teh
         Intahweb, instead of (say) two or three weak jokes being
         enforced on us by the goliath media conglomerate juntahs,
         we can now suffer billions of April Fool japes, merrily
         filling up your inbox, clogging your RSS feed, and archiving
         and indexing themselves for eternity - to the point where
         the whole tradition has moved from "an excuse for funny
         jokes" to "day of the tedious lies". The funniest ones remain
         the self-reflexive fools: Google Mail *chortle*, Freeserve
         renaming itself Wanadoo *snurk*... and, for us, this
         wording on a recent Dreamweaver Upgrade FAQ: "Q. Is there any
         new functionality in this update? A. This update does not
         add any new functionality to Dreamweaver MX 2004. We wanted
         to offer the updater to our users for free and, to comply
         with US accounting rules, we couldn't include any additional
         functionality and not charge for it." Excellent prank on the
         already jittery Free Software Movement, Macromedia. In
         America, you legally can't provide features *without*
         charging money? Told you we should have fought the TANSTAAFL
         Act of 2003 while we had the chance, comrades!

         the vast majority of quarters", and so he's now on for
         rolling them out as quickly as poss. Must have been that "ID 
         cards would have saved the Morecambe Bay cockle pickers"
         argument that won us all over, then. Meanwhile, those two
         last stragglers, Ross Anderson and John Gilmore met the
         full logical force of the opposition's arguments. John
         Gilmore's commendably quixotic attempt to show that he
         shouldn't have to show ID on internal flights stumbled in 
         the US courts; and poor old Ross Anderson finds he has to 
         show a passport to cash a thousand quid cheque at his home 
         branch of Natwest. I think that's *them* convinced of the 
         need for compulsory ID, Prime Minister.

</span><span class="item">         Occasionally an established bit of code passes out of
         circulation, and waits for its moment to come again. History
         files become legend, Freshmeat entries become myth, and some
         programs that should not have been forgotten... are lost.
         So it is with DSNIFF, the humble password sniffer and arp
         poisoner from yesteryear. Last toyed with by author Dug Song
         back in 2000, dsniff has theoretically been replaced with
         far more sophisticated network analysis tools. But only
         no-one but the self-consciously l33t understands ettercap,
         and the rest appear to be mostly half-completed
         script-kiddie promotional products. What dsniff does is
         simple: you run it (or one of the suite of programs it comes
         with), and it tells you what passwords are in the clear on
         your network. From POP3 to unencrypted SAMBA to http auth to
         (a sign of its ancient origins) the old Napster. Its
         filter file is simple so you can add your own; its output is
         obvious and often revealing. In these days of open WiFi
         networks, dsniff's utility has grown. And, sad to say, most
         of the plaintext passwords it was sniffing in 2000 are still
         sailing past under our noses today.

         Melissa "Sabrina" Joan Hart high-school nerd makeover DRIVE ME 
         CRAZY (12midnight, Fri, ITV)... and Spalding Gray monologue 
         GRAY'S ANATOMY (11.40pm, Fri, BBC4) contains no "actual

         a popular comedian *wasn't happy*, confides LES DAWSON'S LOST 
         DIARIES (9.10pm, Sat, C4)... don't know about you, but we 
         can't get enough of the saucy serial killer subject of 
         OVERKILL: THE AILEEN WUORNOS STORY (11.05pm, Sat, C5)... as 
         the realisation that the past is more exciting with a pounding 
         rock soundtrack is simultaneously arrived at by HISTORYONICS 
         (6.30pm, Sun, BBC1) and DARING RAIDS OF WORLD WAR II (7.30pm, 
         Wed, C5)... the winner of BODYGUARDS (8pm, Sun, C4) goes on to 
         face "Regency House SAS Are You Tough Enough" in the final... 
         then the terrestrial premier of flying swordfight nonsense 
         CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON (9pm, Sun, C4) is unfortunately 
         scheduled against defensible Damon/ Affleck math-'em-up GOOD 
         WILL HUNTING (9pm, Sun, BBC2), a low-key start to a week of 
         horror which also features SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE (11pm, Sun, 
         BBC2), NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (12.25am, Sun, BBC2), director

         "Shaggy" Lillard mystery DEAD MAN'S CURVE (11.35pm, Mon, 
         BBC1), plus the original - which the remake TV ad curiously 
         portrays itself as "better than" - DAWN OF THE DEAD (11.20pm, 
         Wed, BBC1)... the dark secrets of Disney are exhumed in 
         OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNES (9pm, Mon, BBC3)... while the anti-fascist 
         message of concentration camp history A LETTER TO LILLI 
         (11.15pm, Wed, BBC1) is so powerful that the Radio Times deems 
         it "required viewing for every child in the country"...

         camera forcing the viewer to focus on her posterior as she 
         climbed into a van; much better than the original Scooby-Doo, 
         not only because of the measurably lesser and fewer issues of 
         assault on ethics and morality but because of just a plain 
         better job at film making and story-telling)... "The Exorcist" 
         - set in a women's prison - is the feelgood pitch for GOTHIKA

         for the nudity, if I were you)... while Mike Myers brings his 
         trademark toilet humour to loose Dr Seuss adaptation THE CAT

         what aims to be the "Magnum 7 Deadly Sins" of 2004, WALLS' 
         CORNETTO LOVE POTIONS (approx 95p), already available in at 
         least 4 varieties including Tiramisu With A Spicy Bite ("the

         revamped (Supersize-option-free) menu featuring a SIDE SALAD

         NESTLE have relaunched their ailing DOUBLE CREAM in bizarre 
         new (Wonkalate-like?) DOUBLE BERRY form ("the raspberry and 
         blackcurrant pieces aren't that special and seem to have come 
         straight out of a cereal bar" - ALEX), and Cadbury sprinkled a

         WITH NUTS ("I was disappointed by this, if only because they'd 
         replaced the oh-so-chewy mallow with crispy-hard nougatine. 
         Hardly within the same product category if you ask me" - 
         FLAMEPROOF)... yet, even overtaking the debut of ROBINSONS
