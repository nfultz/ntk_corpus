</span><span class="item">         The Net, said Jonathan (not the) Miller in this weeks' GUARDIAN, 
         is "a seething mass of fraud and disinformation", where "it is
         more important to be cool than true". This is, as far as we
         could work out from his article, because it lacks all the
         "traditional checking and sourcing" of the proper media.
         Thank God, then, for the professional journalist. Among the
         hard-hitting news stories, carefully examined for veracity
         and then lovingly reprinted in the infinitely more
         trustworthy national press, was the BILL SUX fake Pentium

         the crashed-saucer technology TRANSFER CAPACITOR ("It's

         the most shocking revelation in the history of UFOs. Or
         both.", mulls TIMES INTERFACE's special correspondent, URI

         TVs (don't those sideways-stretched faces get annoying, he
         asks, without mentioning that you can turn them off). And -
         just by coincidence - almost every story that Miller cited
         as being the fault of the Net. Still, we're sure they'll all

</span><span class="item">         It's been a contentious time in the Quake Movie community
         recently, what with the poor box office of THE TOILET
         TRAGEDY, and the unexpected critical panning of HOMOSEXUAL
         FILM REVIEWERS ("I was appalled... Every single line in the
         movie seemed to centre around us being gay" - Psyck's
         Popcorn Jungle, "We know that the 'film' Homosexual Film
         Reviewers was born from your gay sexual frustration with
         your brother" - Q-Corpse). Next week, however, all critics'
         lips will be pursed, every filmmakers' gaze turned toward
         CLAN PHANTASM, producers of this Summer's blockbuster,
         DEVIL'S COVENANT. Preview screenings were not available at
         time of going to press, but Devil's Covenant surely
         promises a revolution in Quake Movieland, if only because
         the q-flick checks in at an astounding *130* minutes
         duration. Could it be the "Birth of a Nation" of this
         youthful medium? Perhaps - although expect more gibbing.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; Errata! While NTK (and all other listings mags)
         genuinely believed it was the Arnie movie called THE
         RUNNING MAN showing last Sun, it was in fact "the
         slightly less futuristic 1960s crime thriller by the same
         name, complete with astonishingly tacky titles
         featuring a shadow mincing around" (subscriber Martin
         Frost)... NTK regrets the error, though not as much as
         the appearance in some satellite listings of "Need To Know:
         Exploring how technology can be fun" as part of the
         new line-up for Sky's [.tv] relaunched computer
         channel. In fact, our "Adam &amp; Joe vs Bob Cringely
         Newsnight" concept chat-show is called 404 NOT FOUND (7pm,
         Thu, Astra transponder 58, 10.847GHz Vertical) -
         webcasts coming soon... be ready for sci-fi B-movies
         tonight, with Dan Aykroyd's CONEHEADS (9pm, Fri, BBC2),
         James Earl Jones hosting a weird double bill remake of THE
         TWILIGHT ZONE: ROD SERLING'S LOST CLASSICS (11.15pm,
         Fri, BBC2), Roger Corman's MST3K fodder IT
         CONQUERED THE WORLD (1.05am, Fri, BBC1), and the truly
         terrible "Sandkings" first-ever remake of THE OUTER
         LIMITS (12.45am, Fri, BBC2)... Sat is even better with
         ROBIN COOK'S FORMULA FOR DEATH (9pm, Sat, BBC1) -
         possibly the best title of the month, even if it is the
         "Coma" author, not the foreign secretary... we did the
         "McCandless" joke last time they scheduled
         FREEJACK (1050pm, Sat, BBC1) back in April... plus Gene
         Roddenberry's post-apocalyptic GENESIS II (12.35am, Sat,
         BBC1)... oh, and "one of the best films of the '80s",
         apparently: De Niro/ Scorsese's RAGING BULL (11.10pm,
         Sat, BBC2)... who'd win in a fight between that Sling Blade
         guy, Gilbert Grape, and Raymond Babbitt from RAIN MAN
         (9.50pm, Sun, BBC1) - especially if they could borrow
         Jack Nicholson's axe from THE SHINING (10pm, Sun,
         C4)?... EQUINOX (9pm, Tue, C4) tries to generate some
         excitement from "laser death rays", while Christian Slater
         uses more conventional techniques to pick off the
         HEATHERS (10pm, Tue, C4), part of C4's new "Vile
         Teens" season - what next, Pump Up The Volume?... the
         A-Team's Amy Allen is one of the few reasons to watch lame
         John Candy Western spoof WAGONS EAST (10pm, Wed,
         BBC1)... and Jon Ronson's vague Edinburgh tie-in
         CRITICAL CONDITION (11pm, Wed, C4) sees Financial Times
         journo and (we think) NTK subscriber Ian Shuttleworth trying
         his hand at stand-up comedy...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CONFECTION CORNER&gt;&gt; seems the print media picked up on the
         "Be My Icon/ Page Me/ Fax Me/ Email Me" versions of LOVE
         HEARTS only after they'd been in distribution for 8 weeks or
         so. Sources (including the startlingly desgined
         <a href="http://www.swizzels-matlow.com">http://www.swizzels-matlow.com</a> ) also confirm that the
         hundreds of slogans on the popular "compressed powder
         sweets" do not yet include "<a href="http://www.cupid">www.cupid</a>" (as was widely
         reported), possibly to avoid embarrassing redirections to,
         say, <a href="http://cupid.net">http://cupid.net</a> ... this month's genuine new brands: a
         5-finger variant of KIT KAT (previously thought indigenous
         only to vending machines in swimming pools), and JOOSTERS,
         the violently flavoured Jelly Bean-battlers from the makers
         of Opal Fruit^N^N^N^N^N Starbursts - we think we'll continue
         getting our fruity chews from POLO GUMMIES... and finally,
         subscriber TONY BLEWS draws attention to the packets of
         SKITTLES ice lolly snacks, which proudly proclaim "Skittles
         - Fun Up!". "I doubt very much that they are fun up most
         orifices", worries Tony, though obviously that depends on
         just how hot your workplace gets...
