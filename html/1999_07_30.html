</span><span class="item">         ADSL! ADSL! Thank God almighty, ADSL! But what's this? Was
         it not ordained for September, when BT now say November? And
         was not the plan for cheap and retail, when BT now
         hand-waves 40UKP-150UKP for reselling to ISPs only? What of
         ordained Prophecy? Put it down to OFTEL once again using
         their Bene-Gesserit-trained Voice on BRITISH TELECOM. The
         unspoken command: either you can jump into subsidised retail
         ADSL next month without adequate warning to the rest of the
         ISP community, in which case we unbundle your local loops so
         fast your shareholders will squint for a decade. Or you can
         do it wholesale and give the competition the trad 90 days to
         get their acts together and - hey, we can take it a little
         slower on that whole co-location jag, man, okay? So, it's
         the latter, ADSL is later, and the price is fixed higher,
         but at least BT isn't blatting every ISP out of existence.
         Those meddling government tyrants, eh? George Gilder must be
         spitting blood. Mind you, datastream junkies that we are,
         our off-the-record stance remains: "They could install it up
         our arse, and make us pay double, and we'd still be up for
         it." Lucky that's also BT's consumer charter. Now,
         wonder what happened to the other secret piece of "New BT"'s
         Autumn strategy: free weekend local calls?

</span><span class="item">         Mind you, BT hardly needs to push its ISP competition around
         when they're so busy kicking their own teeth in. Take one
         leading brand, currently in the middle of switching from one
         network provider to another. This week they transferred
         their registration system to point at the new telco. And
         watched, aghast, when somebody in the old network operation
         centre locked them out of their own systems, re-pointed it
         back, and disdainfully restored from backups. The battle of
         who "owns" the server is still going on, with his own senior
         management still trying pursuade the employee to unchain
         himself from the server rack and come quietly. Don't listen
         to them, kid! The war never ended!

         regarding a threatened Nominet IPO coup and domain
         price-cuts would have been eerily prescient, were it not for
         the fact that both events had already occurred two days
         previously at the UK domain authority's AGM. Carpet-baggers
         were routed, and the cost (to Nominet members) of a .co.uk
         dropped to a fiver. Sorry: we're not used to your species'
         linear conception of time. Thank goodness we have NTK
         near-regular STUART CAMPBELL to point out us that Heinz Wolff
         is *not* dead in this dimension, and was due to bellow
         "Beware - I LIVE!" at the launch of SINISTAR UNLEASHED
         yesterday. Gratifyingly, however, it seems that FRONTIERS
         magazine *has* recently suspended publication; some would
         say, not before time. Plus, it turns out that Commodore
         *had* been at war with QNX all along, according to the World
         Of Amiga "special edition" of Amiga Insight (official
         publication of the Amiga Kickstart User Group), who kick off
         with: "QNX: The embedded OS is by no means inferior, but has
         less of an industry profile today than the Atari ST!" Full

         (closing date next Fri 1999-08-06), why not head out to the
         continent, and see how our Germanic friends celebrate the
         gradual shut-down of summer? CHAOS COMPUTER CLUB are holding
         a HIP-style camp-out next weekend (from 1999-08-06), with a
         Douglas Adams-themed hacking fest in a "field near Berlin".
         Given it's only a week after the Britain's own Terry
         Pratchett-obsessed CLARECRAFT 1999 (this weekend: camping,
         ubiquitous Discworld dressing-up, scary David Hodges in "a
         field near Suffolk"), we hope both events are a cover for
         the long-awaited ADAMS-PRATCHETT ARMAGEDDON, when the two
         fan armies destroy each other, to the relief of all. Amiga
         users will be partying like it's 1989 at the 8th ASSEMBLY
         DEMO PARTY (also from 1999-08-06), at the Hartwall Areena,
         near Helsinki. And, most innovative of all, there's the
         LINUXBIERWANDERUNG (from Sat 1999-08-07), where - of course
         - Linux users hike the hills, caves and "brewpubs" of North
         Eastern Bavaria. Following recent tourist tragedies, let's
         hope they don't attempt any "extreme OS advocacy" without
         the aid of properly trained instructors.

</span><span class="item">         IMPRISE/BORLAND/IMPRISE/BORLAND's generous release of
         centuries-old Turbo C and Pascal binaries (on a dual PIII
         machine, short pieces of 1986 Turbo C code will now compile and
         run before they've been written), the trend is on for
         companies to release their older development environments.
         Jumping the gun somewhat is UNCREATIVE ARCHIVES, which
         contains links to such unsanctioned memorabilia as WINDOWS
         1.04, and GW-BASIC. Please do not download these, as that's
         piracy, and anyway they'll have gone before you've read
         this. Amazingly, though, they will still have lasted longer
         than Dennis Ritchie's warez cache of vintage pre-struct C
         compilers from the mid-seventies (he can't date them exactly
         because "we kept changing the epoch"). We're assuming some
         disaster on the Bell Labs Web server has deleted this
         directory. Unless it's Kernighan slapping a cease and desist?

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; the only VIRTUOSITY (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1) visible in the
         Denzel Washington VR flop is in the title; director Brett
         "Lawnmower Man" Leonard went on to make 3D Imax clunker "T-Rex:
         Back to the Cretaceous"... to our jaded eyes, SciFi's cyber-anime
         double bill AKIRA (9.30pm, Fri, SciFi) and GHOST IN THE SHELL
         (12am, Fri, SciFi) resemble super-long cut-sequences from
         PlayStation games - though they're often the best bits, aren't
         they?... and C4 embarks on a long, wasted WITHNAIL WEEKEND (from
         12.05am, Fri, C4), with the "cult" Richard E Grant shouting vehicle
         at 11.15pm, Sat, plus a Kevin Bacon-like link to the pre-Powers
         WAYNE'S WORLD (10.40pm, Sat, BBC1), where Ralph Brown all but
         reprises his "Danny" role in the sequel... thanks to whistle-
         blowers like <a href="http://www.templarlodge.com">http://www.templarlodge.com</a> , we now know that
         above-average sci-fi spin-offs like STARGATE SG-1 (7pm, Sun, C4)
         are merely an AOL-backed CIA plot to foster belief in ancient
         Egyptian gods and space aliens... again underestimating public
         opinion, C5 settle for WIN BEADLE'S MONEY (7pm, Mon, C5) rather
         than guaranteed ratings-winner KICK BEADLE'S HEAD IN... groping
         for a plot even more preposterous than "Face/Off", John Woo
         directs Dolph Lundgren in BLACKJACK (9pm, Tue, C5) - "a former US
         Marshall turned bodyguard must overcome his phobia of the colour
         white"... and uber-geek stand-up Simon "League Against Tedium"
         Munnery hopefully serves up some hand-held vidcam construction
         tips to enliven this year's run of Festival frolics, EDINBURGH
         OR BUST (11.40pm, Thu, C4)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; not so much "more of the same", but rather just "the
         same" is the verdict on AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME
         (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/austinpowers.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/austinpowers.htm</a> : fighting
         including Springer type fighting; punk dress; machine gunfire
         from the breasts of a fem-bot; dancing to entice; adult
         underwear; suggestive eye movement; picture nudity; nudity under
         sheets; Dr Evil sensually sucking his little finger; 1 use of
         "Oh, thank God" after inspecting self for explosion damage to
         genitalia; mockery of Christ - "The power of Christ compels you"
         from The Exorcist). As in cult hit original, cleverly crude set-
         pieces wallow in plotless, paceless mire, and Dr Evil eventually
         steals the show, (though the songs were better in the first
         one). Then again, all Bond films are exactly the bloody same, so
         maybe that's what they're spoofing...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         IT'S A SMALL WORLD (OF AMIGA) AFTER ALL&gt;&gt; well, we were
         happy to come away with a UKP20 composite monitor and a hard
         drive for the office A1200, but NTK's Amiga-owning readers
         are, naturally, a more discerning bunch. EDD DUMBILL enjoyed
         the free orange squash and choc-chip biscuits given away by
         one exhibitor, reminding him of a "WI coffee morning", but
         the most extensive coverage came from PHILIP "Groovy
         Gadgets" CORNER <a href="http://www.aurora1.demon.co.uk/gadgets">http://www.aurora1.demon.co.uk/gadgets</a> , who
         we hand you over to, now, live from the floor... highlight
         of the show is the first public display of OS 3.5, featuring
         such revolutionary features as: printer drivers that drive
         printers; icons that glow when you click them; an installer
         that lets you go (shock) *back*!, and can open its window on
         its own screen, which could be any colour; and an e-mail
         client, internet stack and web browser which nobody will use
         because we already have better ones. Turnout is good - about
         300-400 people on Saturday alone, checking out treats like
         Javascript-enable IBrowse, games T-Zero and Wasted Dreams, a
         working demo of Wipeout 2097 for Power Amiga, and Amiga girl
         band Annex performing hits like "Back For The Future" and
         "Keep The Momentum Going" - amusing mistranslated lyrics at
         <a href="http://www.perez.de/annex/">http://www.perez.de/annex/</a> . The winner of a brand new
         one-off specially painted A1200 is not in the crowd when his
         name is called, and neither is the second person... many
         attendees seem unaware of the OS fiasco for the new machine,
         by now immune to the apparent "Okay, we've got 18 months to
         do this. No hurry. Anyone for a four player game of Worms?"
         attitude of Amiga management. It looks like the AmigaNG will
         be significantly diluted from its original grand aims,
         becoming another doomed "me too!" PC-beater (!) like the
         Acorn Archimedes.  We don't need a machine to run Linux on;
         I can already do that with the machine on my desk right now.
         Gateway owner (and hence owner of Amiga technology) Ted
         Waitt concludes that Amiga was "definitely not a computer
         business". Hmm. Perhaps he thinks they're re-working all
         those A1200 cases into novelty door-wedges...
