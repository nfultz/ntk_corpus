         gorilla ever to stalk the Earth" routine this week, as they
         reeled in mock astonishment from the inevitable DOJ/State
         Attorneys General lawsuits. Bill played for time, pleading
         with the authorities to postpone the wrangling over Windows
         98 until 1999, when he was sure it would sort itself out.
         There were signs, however, that Gates' wimp mask is
         beginning to slip. Shortly after the action was filed, a US
         communications satellite "ceased to function", taking out
         vital pager services and public radio across the continent.
         Was this the "damage to the economy" Bill was hinting at
         last week? One satellite per week, Mr Klein, until you
         submit to our demands...

         a deal with TELEDESIC, merging their high-bandwidth, global
         data wherever you want it, low-earth-orbit satellite
         constellations. Or maybe it is _ after all, Teledesic is
         backed by Bill G, and with their main competitor now their
         bestest friend (to the tune of some $750 million for a 26%
         share in the project), Teledesic looks to be developing a
         monopoly in the space-based Net, too. That is, of course,
         if it all works. Everyone's waiting for this September,
         when Motorola's lower-fi proof-of-concept voice 'n' pager
         network, Iridium, gets plugged in. So who do you get to
         cheer? Well, UK/French Matra Marconi is in the Teledesic
         deal somewhere, and you can always put a shout out for
         Hammersmith-Broadway-Shopping-Centre-based ICO, who aren't
         as flashy, aren't as rich, are only providing global mobile
         phone functionality, and haven't really got going yet. But

         almost total assimilation by agency.com, we're pegging this

         merged with Oyster "10 Downing Street" Systems, to become
         Oyster Partners. We'll peg that down as death to KBW, which

         ceaseless work on XML parsers, IRC Perl interfaces, and
         dull bug patches to GNU libraries! You're the very model of
         a Open Source contributor, and now you want to HAVE SOME
         FUN. Can we suggest you take a look at SABRE, the Free
         Software flight simulator? It runs on Linux and Windows 95,
         looks smoochy in hi-res SVGA graphics, and has all the
         source you'd ever want to idly toy with. Alternatively, you
         could download, kick it up, and watch the flashencockpits
         und blinkenHUDs. As an added bonus, the "Flight Model" is
         so simplistic, you can actually fly the plane without
         having taken a degree in aeronautics.

</span><span class="item">         By now, you've probably heard what the big AMIGA news was
         last week. If you haven't, we bet you don't even care. But
         for those of you who love the Amiga scene, not for the the
         endlessly postponed OS announcements, but for the flush-
         faced camaraderie, the real news is the release of the
         brand new Amiga theme song, "Back for the Future". Teutonic
         in flavour, and insufficiently martial for our liking (we
         hoped it would sound like the Red Army Choir on the eve of
         the Battle of Stalingrad), it should nonetheless bring a
         tear to anyone who had an Amiga Forever sig. A CD of the
         song is also available, which features an extended remix,
         the Boing Ball noise and a speech by Petro Tyschtschenko.
         You think we'd make this stuff up?

         excessive consumption of Victor Lewis-Smith's TV OFFAL
         (11pm, Fri, C4)... fans *wish* there had "only one" with
         the arrival of HIGHLANDER III: THE SORCERER (10.25pm, Fri,
         BBC1)... sadly, it isn't Kevin Kelly on the receiving end
         of a fatal drugs overdose in John Belushi bio-pic WIRED
         (12.40am, Fri, "some" ITV)... and, enraged by Lewis-Smith's
         pranks, a wheelchair-bound physicist goes on a murderous
         rampage in THE CRIMES OF STEPHEN HAWKE (2.40am, Fri, C4)...
         this week's C4 theme night based around cheaty-pants panel-
         game re-creation QUIZ SHOW (9pm, Sat, C4)... if you only
         ever see one episode of SOUTH PARK (10pm, Sat, Sky1;
         repeated 11pm, Sun), make sure it's the debut of magic
         excrement, and '90s icon, "Mr Hankey"... Roger Corman's
         "cult" (ie dreadful) THE DAY THE WORLD ENDED (1.30am, Sat,
         BBC2) unwittingly heralds a brief sci-fi season called -
         unbelievably - "Out Of This World"... and two words sum up

         docu WHEN WE WERE KINGS (9.50pm, Sun, BBC2) punches out

         heavy-handed beeb satire IN THE RED (9pm, Tue, BBC2)
         unlikely to be as funny as US teens vs Commies classic RED

         patiently for someone to point out that he [DS Collingwood]
         played Jerec in Jedi Knight. You'd think he'd remember."...
         and no doubt it's logical chronology rather than pseudo-
         porn ratings-grabbing that ensures an early outing for the
         "reproduction" episode of THE HUMAN BODY (10.20pm, Wed,
         BBC1)...

         satire / gay / career / film-industry / dog / sexual-
         harassment / actors / soap / money / waiter / modelling /
         acting) - but hasn't twigged that he'll never be as good
         again as Living In Oblivion... like any good car crash,
         move on, there's nothing to see in wholly unnecessary
         sequel BLUES BROTHERS 2000 (MPAA rated: PG-13 for "exotic
         dancing and some language") - worst of all, it isn't even
         set in the year 2000!...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FIGHT TO REPLY&gt;&gt; many have leapt to the defence of Lynda
         LaPlante's much maligned Killer Net, some not even directly
         linked to the making of the programme... DAVID AMOR
         confesses "I was the consultant that LaPlante Productions
         hired to advise on the script," and goes on to reassure us
         that the tech stuff *was* all theoretically possible,
         albeit highly unlikely. "I know what can and can't be done
         on the Internet," he concludes. "Please keep my e-mail
         address anonymous." Smart move, David - apparently there's
         some real nutjobs out there... MARK JORDAN of Compuhire
         wasn't too proud to admit that "I run the company which
         provided Killer Net with all the computer hardware and
         software... as well as your Technical Criticisms I would
         also welcome any comments on how you would prefer to see
         the net portrayed on UK film &amp; TV productions." Hmm, how
         about moderately sensibly, like in Neighbours? That'd be a
         start... and re: the "75 [or 90] per cent of material on
         the Net is porn" debate [see NTK 08/05/98], .net editor
         RICHARD LONGHURST responds "It heartens me to see that you
         at NTK bother to read .net, though you obviously failed to
         appreciate the Killer Net rent-a-stat irony." Oh, .net is
         supposed to be *ironic* now is it? Well, *that's* a
         relief... Arawak's SHANE WALTER ingeniously queried our
         description of the ICA's ONEDOTZERO2 [also NTK 08/05/98] as
         the "usual blurry nonsense", proclaiming "nothing usual
         about this stuff matey! ...we replaced the workstations
         with Sony PlayStations for the week... conceptual art went
         out the window as the black sweatered art elite tore up
         track in Gran Turismo!" Hey, maybe that'll get them to up
         the frame rates in their "art"... "Thanks for mis-
         representing my comments about PGP so wildly in your
         newsletter," chortles Chris Ward-Johnson (aka The Times'
         Interface DR KEYBOARD). "Pity you didn't see fit to carry
         my subsequent article on it - or perhaps you do know some
         way to ensure the provenance of a public key without some
         secure method of transmission?" Well, you could just phone
         them up with your PGP *fingerprint* (unless you don't trust
         the phones, in which case your "secure FTP" solution sounds
         a bit silly, doesn't it?), or build up a trust network
         using the public keyservers - though surely a *real* doctor
         would know that?... and finally, thanks to everyone who
         pointed out that typing "Need To Know" into
         <a href="http://www.realnames.com">www.realnames.com</a> [NTK 08/05/98] actually takes you to a
         syphilis information page, but the last word goes to LLOYD
         WOOD, who contrasts line 171 in NTK 17/04/98 ("...shut the
         HELL UP") with line 52 in NTK 18/07/97 ("...shut the fuck
         up!"), positing that we used "hell" more in 1998 and "fuck"
         more in '97 - "Either all the amusement's gone out of it
         now the CDA's toast, or you guys are slowly losing your
         balls... still, it's a necessary move for mass-market
         American acceptance." Au contraire, Lloyd, au contraire - a
         quick session with our search CGI reveals that NTK has
         *already* used as many cuss-words in 1998 than in the whole
         of last year, ie (1997 values in brackets): 9 (9) fucks, 9
         (12) shits, 1 (0) cunts, 5 (2) bollocks, 1 (0) use of the
         phrase "sucks dogs' cocks in hell" and - for all you
         <a href="http://www.screenit.com">www.screenit.com</a> fans out there - 3 (6) uses of "God" and 0
         (2) uses of "Jesus" as exclamations...
