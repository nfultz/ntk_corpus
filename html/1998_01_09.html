</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A brilliant but possibly sociopathic recluse, accused of
         creating intricate devices that spread terror across a
         nation - a universally reviled figure, caught by the
         authorities after twenty years' pursuit - he is on trial
         for his very life. But can the man the US government claim
         is behind the "Unibrowser" threat truly defend himself - or
         is BILL GATES just too mad? The evidence points to the
         latter, after a series of increasingly paranoid outbursts
         over the pending anti-trust case. After last month's
         unsuccessful attack on the judge (the so-called "you
         talkin' to me?" defence), MICROSOFT this week turned on the
         court-appointed investigator, Lawrence Lessig. Lessig, they
         said, had exchanged e-mail with friends at Netscape in
         which he accused Microsoft's Explorer of "screwing up" his
         bookmarks. Clear bias, said MS - presumably as Lessig had
         failed to refer to the bookmarks as "Microsoft Favourites",
         the new name for bookmarks on the Microsoft Web(TM).
         Meanwhile in BusinessWeek, Gates made the demented claim
         that the current anti-MS backlash is being secretly run
         by... IBM. "People don't understand," he says, "how IBM set
         out to eliminate us ... Unless we're allowed to enhance
         Windows, [it] would certainly be eliminated." Enemies
         everywhere, and only one brave man protecting us from an
         OS/2 planet: expect more insights into the fractured mind
         of Bill as the trial progresses.

</span><span class="item">         Meanwhile, the anti-Bill, STEVE JOBS, won over everyone
         with his "humble, moi?" keynote speech in the ever-
         shrinking planet of MACWORLD. Jobs continued to keep the
         big announcements for another time (so no sub-$1000 Mac
         announcement, no new servers, no Rhapsody gameplan), and
         merely kicked around the same QuickTime, Microsoft-Are-Our-
         Friends, online shopping nonsense. Oh, and one other thing
         - Apple made a profit in the last quarter of $45 million.
         Yeah, surprised you, didn't he? Only five more years of
         profits like that, and Apple will have paid back the $884
         million it frittered away in the other three quarters.
         Other Macworld turn-ups: there's a new Debabelizer,
         Freehand 5.0 came out, and errmm... errr...

</span><span class="item">         As spammers threatened to publish a database of AOL
         addresses on the Net (isn't that what USENET is these
         days?), Microsoft cut out the middle man and bought out the
         entire HOTMAIL free-mail-on-the-Web operation, addresses
         and all. The deal cost Microsoft around $350 million. Given
         that Hotmail claims 9.5 million users, that's about $35 a
         pal. Cheap if you consider the hundreds of dollars spent
         per head trying to get MSN subscribers; expensive if you
         just think Hotmail is just a bunch of people too stingy to
         stay with one ISP longer than the free trial - or if you've
         seen the spams offering 16 million email addresses for
         $149. It all comes down to what Microsoft plan to do with
         these people. And you know what? We reckon they have *no
         idea*, but they'll watch what Yahoo does with its
         cheapskate free e-mail subscribers, then copy that. Yes,
         Yahoo's next on that Microsoft "imitate to eliminate" a la
         carte menu.

</span><span class="item">         QuickTime 3.0? Pah! DVD? Yeah, right. Maybe it's time to
         revive arguably *the* most extreme video compression codec
         of all time: TTYVIDEO. Developed by Chris Pirazzi, it takes
         any SGI video input and turns it into live ASCII art. And
         not only does it look cool (apparently it's particularly
         good with cartoons), Chris lists a huge range of off-the-
         shelf ttyvideo utilities that you may already own: Real-
         time compression? compress file.movie ! Full pixel-level
         editing: emacs file.movie (or vi! or jot!). If only we can
         convince a few RealPlayer users to switch, the bandwidth
         will all come *flooding* back. We mention this now, because
         this technique has recently been advanced by Czech demo
         coders, who have ported an entire PC graphics library to
         work with realtime ASCII art. We suspect it's no
         coincidence that this library is call-compatible with the
         graphics libraries used by Linux Doom and Quake. Yes, you
         read that right - ASCII Doom. ASCII Quake. And if you can't
         be bothered with that, the "bb" demo is still fun.

</span><span class="item">         Pens. Lovely, aren't they? But loveliest of all is the UNI
         pen breed, those transparent rollerballs that are usually
         quite expensive and whose purchase involves going into art
         shops and pretending to be all trendy. Fortunately, someone
         persuaded Uni to put up a Web site which semi-automatically
         gives away their products to anyone who completes a simple
         trivia test. At last, a UNI distribution system that
         rewards the intelligent over the stylish! Sadly, the site
         uses Macromedia Flash, so they won't be getting the truly
         singular. But what need have they of pens?

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; big comedy clash tonight, with no less than 6 new
         humour-oriented shows, including thankfully-Bremner-free
         satire THE FRIDAY NIGHT ARMISTICE (9.35pm, Fri, BBC2),
         cheapo sketch-romp COMEDY NATION (12.05am, Fri, BBC2),
         sitcom-of-Satan DRESSING FOR BREAKFAST (9.30pm, Fri, C4),
         and the reliably formulaic EUROTRASH (10.30pm, Fri, C4)...
         our picks: the top-class neuroses of FRASIER (10pm, Fri,
         C4) and - wait for it - the vastly underrated FAITH IN THE
         FUTURE (8.30pm, Fri, ITV)... it's the most sexually
         explicit kids' advice show we've ever seen (well, at least
         by post-Chart-Show standards) - is that why only swinging
         Londoners get LOVE BITES (12.30pm, Sat, LWT)?... you'll
         wish Invisible-Man-Behaving-Badly Neil Morrissey *would*
         disappear from THE VANISHING MAN (8pm, Sat, ITV)... three-
         way TV cops go bad, with the first-and-best NAKED GUN movie
         (9.05pm, Sat, BBC1), the Lalo-Schiffrin-scored Dirty-Harry-
         sequel MAGNUM FORCE (10.05pm, Sat, ITV) and blah-blah-
         Tarantino gritty-no-music failed-heister DOG DAY AFTERNOON
         (11.05pm, Sat, C4)... basically another sinisterly amusing
         genetic comedy for Arnold "Twins" Schwarzenegger, though
         JUNIOR (7.15pm, Sun, BBC1) does spawn some acutely
         disturbing shots of the heavily pregnant former Terminator
         gambolling in a flowery meadow, dressed as a girl... no
         real revelations about the Challenger shuttle explosion, as
         DISASTER (8pm, Mon, BBC2) implicates the "O Rings" - maybe
         they should have used some other, tougher, crispy cheese
         snack instead... BBC2 temporarily consoles fans of soon-to-
         conclude SEINFELD (11.15pm, Tue, BBC2) with a double
         episode... Sean Connery yawns through aimless sci-fi
         Western OUTLAND (10pm, Tue, C4)... and TV Nation sidekick
         strikes out on his own in LOUIS THEROUX'S WEIRD WEEKENDS
         (9.30pm, Thu, BBC2) - ObNTK: is he the son of novelist Paul
         Theroux? Yes, of *course* he is...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES&gt;&gt; yes, that's Emma Thompson *and her real-life mum*
         in not-as-dull-as-you'd-think luvvie-fest THE WINTER GUEST
         (MPAA: rated R for "language and brief sensuality") -
         fortunately, director Alan "Die Hard" Rickman sticks behind
         the camera... not too many "stiffy" jokes in similarly
         death-obsessed quirky love story KISSED (imdb: romance/
         morgue/ drama/ necrophilia)... Jennifer Aniston continues
         turning down tough-action-heroine roles for average
         romantic fluff like PICTURE PERFECT (MPAA: rated PG-13 for
         "sensuality and related dialogue")... fans of Wim Wenders'
         rambling Euro-musings should know just what to expect from
         THE END OF VIOLENCE (imdb: thriller/ drama/ big-brother/
         fbi/ film-industry/ lost-identity/ violence) - except
         perhaps some odd slapstick bits, loads of CCTV action,
         ID4's Bill Pullman, and that bald guy off Murder One... oh,
         when we did THE JACKAL (MPAA: rated R for "strong violence
         and language") last week by accident, we forgot to ask: for
         sheer ridiculous pointlessness, could Bruce Willis'
         disguises maybe even rival Val Kilmer's ones from The
         Saint?...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         "ZINE" NOT "HERD"&gt;&gt; Our New Year resolution was to get this
         unhealthy love/hate obsession with US ratpile media out of
         our system, so what better way than a final binge of Yank
         zines from New York's SEE HEAR - <a href="http://www.zinemart.com">http://www.zinemart.com</a>
         ... looks like we arrived just in time, with the best of
         the US small-press publishers sailing out on well-earned
         book deals: the first 16 issues of Lisa Suckdog's grunge
         slag zine ROLLERDERBY ($3, PO Box 474, Dover, NH 03821) has
         made it to book form (ISBN: 0922915385), while the zine
         itself rolls on with interviews with Beck and neo-nazis in
         the latest ish... Paul Lukas' obscurely titled BEER FRAME
         ($3, 160 St. Johns Place, NY 11217) translated to the
         marginally more informatively titled INCONSPICUOUS
         CONSUMPTION (ISBN: 0517886685), a commendable trawl through
         the reject bin of modern consumer products and services...
         but our favourites sell-outs from the East Coast remain the
         "old people say the craziest things" oral histories in THE
         DUPLEX PLANET and its various comic spin-offs ($2.50, PO
         BOX 1230, Saratoga Springs, NY 12866), and the
         *spectacularly* self-destructing HATE COMIC #28 ($3.95, c/o
         Fantagraphics, 7563 Lake City Way NE, WA 98115) whose well-
         deserved success seems to have led creator Peter Bagge to
         kill off everyone's favourite characters... in the "wish
         we'd never seen it" category, we can't imagine FUCK ($5,
         Randall Phillip, PO Box 2217, PA 19103) would ever sell out
         to The Man, and even if there was a market for full-colour-
         shotgun-wound coffee table books, we'd never get it past
         Customs... back on this side of the stormy pond, following
         the runaway success of Brit slacker bible THE IDLER
         (recently relaunched, now with even more time-wasting
         pages), they also do a sort of semi-pro junior spin-off
         called CHEAP DATE (UKP 1.00, PO BOX 16778, London EC1M
         5XA), "for thinking thrifters". A bit Londony, suspiciously
         high B-list celebrity count, perhaps too self-consciously
         '70s kitsch (like Ben Is Dead did to death). But good on T-
         shirts, fun to read, and cheap - just like it says on the
         tin.

         competition - a book about how to get on the UK Internet
         (sorry), the audio soundtrack to MDK (joke: if Nintendo
         ever released it, they'd say it stood for "Mums, Dads &amp;
         Kids") - and perhaps the most cruel and unusual punishment
         gift of all, a 3-year-old video called GAMES ON THE .NET
         published by Pearson New Entertainment in conjunction with
         SubCyberia and hosted by "virtual celebrity" WAVEY DAVEY
         WINDER. *Thrill* to Davey's pioneeringly matey presenting
         style, bravely avoiding obvious traps like ever making eye
         contact with the camera. *Gasp* at the cover's bold
         assertion that you should "Say goodbye to games consoles"
         (hey, it was 1995, how could they have known?). And
         *cringe* with horrified nostalgia at the free CompuServe
         software included with the video, offering "over UKP 80 of
         free surfing", all on just one floppy disc! Games On The
         Net is available now in Virgin Megastores for UKP 1.99. And
         even we don't know the current whereabouts (or career
         prospects) of Mr "Wavey" Davey Winder. But we'll try and
         track him down to receive our "special" award at the
         endlessly trailed, probably in Feb, fabulous .NOT Awards.
