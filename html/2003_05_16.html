</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">        "Well, I think I've found your problem", replied fistfuls of
         concerned readers after getting bounced last week from the
         published email of Beverley Hughes, Minister of Counting ID
         Consultation Entries. Fortunately, during the consultation,
         STAND didn't relay the thousands of comments we received
         directly to her. No, we sent them to the swanky "we're so
         wired" official consultation email address. Word has it
         that they did get them okay, but that the entire
         STAND-relayed wodge is now assumed to be one ginormous
         Internet "petition", rather than a bunch of individual
         statements. We'd still like that confirmed in writing,
         though. Or an email would do. Apparently, the best way to
         pry an explanation from a Minister is to get an MP to ask
         questions in the house. Given that Ms Hughes isn't easily
         contactable, maybe you'd like to contact yours? Duplicate
         questions won't be a problem: if they squint, we're sure the
         government can can just collapse them into one giant MP.
         With just one big voter standing behind them, glowering.

</span><span class="item">         You call things names, you end up being called names: that's
         just the way these things go. First there was the hyper-active 
         farce of Firebird (the Mozilla browser) versus Firebird (the 
         database). For those of you not bothering to keep up, Firebird 
         the database was a fork of software that was called Interbase 
         which was owned by Borland a company which used to be called 
         Inprise and before that used to be called Borland, deep 
         breath. You'd think the Firebird developers would by now be 
         accustomed to the transitory nature of names, but nooo. They 
         were *shocked* when Mozilla started using the term Firebird, 
         and insisted they were the *only* Firebird on the block, even 
         though a) there were dozens of software Firebirds before them 
         (including BT's short-lived games division) and b) the only 
         thing anyone can remember about Firebird the DB was that it 
         had massive security hole wired into it by Borland^WInprise^W 
         Borland that took them six months to find. Dire threats were 
         hurled, until Mozilla pointed out that the Firebird name was 
         just the semi-internal *project* name, and since no-one calls 
         the current browser "Seamonkey" (*its* project name), they 
         should calm the motherfirebird down.

</span><span class="item">         Readers with long memories may recall Carl Sagan getting
         into a similar tizzy about an internal Apple project that
         shared his name - until he threatened to sue. Apple's coders
         renamed the project's title to "Butthead Astronomer", which
         strangely failed to mollify him. Perhaps that explains some
         of the background of the next naming war: Apple asking the
         FreeBSD hackers to change the #definition of one of their
         error codes. Apparently, EDOOFUS has "raised eyebrows" at
         the corporation, and they've refused to accept the merge
         into Darwin ("a little more in-your-face than ...
         'die_you_gravy_sucking_pigdog()'", apparently). Among the
         suggested replacements in the subsequent bikeshed discussion
         was EBUTTHEAD, and a note that in an old Apple II
         incarnation, STUPID stood for "Student Programmer ID". They
         settled on EDONTPANIC. At least, until the Estate of Douglas
         Adams puts up a fight.

</span><span class="item">         Can you still be anonymous online? Why yes you can, Mr JAMES
         BOND, of 999 Letsby Avenue, Afghanistan 90210. Like all
         crypto-wankery, doing so mostly involves ploughing through
         18 or so HOWTOs written in one overexcited night by a tripping 
         and cypherpunk in 1995, then extrapolating from there. But 
         it's getting easier. That stalwart of anonymous remailing,
         MIXMASTER, has been stealthily getting more user-friendly
         over the last couple of years. Nowadays there's a
         text-menuing system for sending out anonymous mails (and
         Usenet postings) that's almost intuitive. There are emacs
         and mutt interfaces. And provisionally you can also create
         nyms that can receive and send anonymous mail too (although
         that seems to segfault in the Debian version and we're far 
         too anonymous to find out why).  Of course, to continue the
         crypto-wankery theme, alt.privacy.anon-server is now a
         market-mandated mess of mutual recrimination, spams and
         hoaxery, but it all seems to work, mostly. So you can stop
         sending us mutually-incriminating mail from work accounts
         now can't you... Mr Bond?
