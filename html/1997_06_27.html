         executes on PCs running Windows. In other words, Microsoft

         hacks are having problems coping with Java's current
         treacly speed and lousy interface. But help *is* on its way
         with a new, optimised Java interpreter that runs up to
         forty times faster than current efforts. Will it arrive in

         dumped BSkyB from its ranks; their vital digital

         BDB now consists of mainly Carlton and Granada, although
         BSkyB and the BBC will provide much of the content. It's
         been a bad month for Murdoch: his head honcho at BSkyB, Sam
         Chisholm quit (reputedly over clashes with Rupertkinder
         Elisabeth Murdoch) and various headaches in the US sent his
         international rep plummeting. Revenge might still be sweet:
         his satellites start broadcasting a range of digital
         services next year, wayyy before BDB. And he's still pals

         groups. Among the breeds documented by DERA are 'elites',
         'darksiders', 'information brokers' and 'meta-hackers'.
         "Meta-hackers are one of the most sinister things I have
         run into," Hood says, "They scare the hell out of me." So
         this isn't Emacs these people are hacking? No - "Meta-
         hackers monitor other hackers without being noticed, and
         then exploit the vulnerabilities identified by the hackers
         they are monitoring." Oooh. Like DERA, maybe?

         than as a TV show?), with Iain Banks (Excession), JM
         Straczynski (Babylon 5), Scott Adams (The Dilbert

         at number 17 in comprehensive A-Z form, there's a couple of
         Pride And Prejudice spin-offs for those more sensitive

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV &gt;&gt; And who are those cheeky geeky guys popping up on
         CYBER CAFE (2.45am, Fri pm/Sat am, LWT; regions may vary) -
         could it be the editors of NTK now?... and are we the only
         people who thought RAIN MAN (10pm, Sat, BBC1) was about the
         hassles of having to look after an annoying yuppie younger
         brother?... The "Into The Unknown" season concludes by
         delving into the human psyche, with behind-the-scenes docu
         MILLENNIUM: FACT OR FICTION (11.05pm, Sat, ITV), 'Nam
         psycho-thriller JACOB'S LADDER (11.55pm, Sat, ITV), and
         Chris Carter going way darker than the X Files in the 'real
         thing', MILLENNIUM (10pm, Sun, ITV)... sticking with sf,
         this current series of THE OUTER LIMITS (9.35pm, Sat, BBC2)
         is pretty dumb - but better than you'd think, at least
         compared to incoherent sixties nonsense like BARBARELLA
         (11.35pm, Mon, BBC1)... sending celebrity lookalikes -
         including Fergie, Madonna, and Nelson Mandela - into
         singles bars is the intriguing premise of all-week
         10-min slot SINGLES (7.50pm, Mon-Fri, C4)... that one with
         the cows and the veggie cult heralds (at last) a decently
         understated episode of THE X FILES (10.20pm, Tue, BBC1),
         followed by  the suspiciously similarly themed movie
         DEEP RED, starring Michael "Terminator" Biehn... and,
         finally, when they call THIS LIFE (9pm, Thu, BBC2) a
         "twenty-something" drama, are they referring to the age of
         the cast or how many sodding episodes it seems to
         have been dragging on for?

</span><span class="geekmedia">         MOVIES &gt;&gt; No-one's dared put out anything decent in the
         same week as Joel Schumacher's BATMAN AND ROBIN (Clooney,
         Arnie, Thurman, blah blah blah) - and that, tragically,
         seems to include BATMAN AND ROBIN. If you haven't yet
         enjoyed the test-screening responses for this $200-million-
         plus stinker, they include such gems as "deplorable", "the
         dialogue was *all* one-liners!", "I would not wish it upon
         my enemies", and, most succinctly, "DEATH TO SCHUMACHER!".
         The full review (from the same reassuringly deranged
         source) reports that punters are now *booing* the
         director's name as soon as it appears on-screen...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         BIO &gt;&gt; Remember reports that LEPTIN is secreted by mice
         when they've had enough to eat? And how everyone scurried
         off to prove that fat people suffer from low levels of
         Leptin? Well, no: turned out we all have the same levels of
         Leptin after all - people are just greedy bastards. Now,
         just as the Leptin funds were vanishing, UK scientists have
         found two obese children with Leptin gene defects. It's so
         nice we now have a human model of a mouse disease... For
         those of us with plenty of sit-down-and-stay: the AMERICAN
         COLLEGE OF SPORTS MEDICINE says that vigorous exercise does
         nothing to improve your health. Moderate occasional
         exercise, however, is of value. This may involve walking,
         playing with children (your own, presumably), breathing and
         moving your bowels. Just do it... A hominid specimen has
         been found in Spain which may be the ancestor of HOMOS
         NEANDERTHAL and SAPIENS. Scientists say it has features of
         both Neanderthal man and Homo Sapiens. Well, so do many
         people I know... CHARLES MURRAY, co-author of the Bell
         Curve, claims in a new study on siblings that IQ correlates
         with higher income, more education, fewer offspring and
         less illegitimacy. Well, I have plenty of degrees and no
         children - so why aren't I earning more? Maybe it's Leptin-
         induced illegitimacy...                 - <a href="mailto:doctor@spesh.com">doctor@spesh.com</a>
