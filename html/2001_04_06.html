</span><span class="item">         After getting yet another breathless 2001-04-01 e-mail 
         informing us that Fucked Company had been hacked by ideaLab, 
         and seeing it was from the founder of Skeptic magazine, no 
         less - we finally conceded that these ONLINE APRIL FOOLS were 
         getting out of hand. None more at risk, though, than those who 
         would toy with the CURSE OF DEBIAN for their jollies. The 
         unfortunately afflicted volunteer group (whose last release 
         commemorated departed developer, Joel 'Espy' Klecker) was 
         shocked to hear from DEBIAN PLANET that their leader BEN 
         COLLINS had died on Sunday - just days after his election. 
         Closer examination of the post (apparently, Ben died of 
         "massive internal inconsistencies" following an OpenLDAP core 
         dump) raised some suspicions. But perhaps the prank would have 
         turned out funnier if Deb maintainers weren't still recovering 
         from the sad - and all too real - passing away of two more key 
         developers, Chris Rutter and Fabrizio Polacco. Well, as one is 
         supposed to say on these occasions, they'd have seen the funny 
         side.

</span><span class="item">         Don't think of this as a Watchdog-style assault on a business 
         who's had some teething problems, think of it as a resounding 
         "well done" to a UK company boldly pushing back those e-
         commerce boundaries. Surely among the cheapest Playstation 2s 
         sold in the UK have come from THESLAMMER.COM, who've run 
         various offers selling the UKP300-retail console for UKP150. 
         Despite reassurances such as their Gameplay-style colour 
         scheme and Sony-esque claims that "they make the money back on 
         the games", said offers have prompted widespread newsgroup 
         speculation over the precise nature of the company's business 
         plan - speculation fuelled by customers who've had problems 
         getting hold of either their consoles or indeed anyone who can 
         tell them when they might arrive. Then again, if you were 
         (theoretically) losing between UKP70 and UKP150 on every sale, 
         would *you* want to be spending even more money on fripperies 
         like customer support?

</span><span class="item">         Here's our standard position on intellectual property: it's 
         not that we're against it per se (and you can quote us on 
         that, for 150UKP residuals, limited first-use rights in 
         Regions 1 and 2 only), but if you're hanging around in a 
         universe where copying is essentially a zero cost, high-
         benefit activity, the only way to deter infringment is to 
         slowly increase the punishment until possession of a CD burner 
         is a hangable offence. Well, they're not quite there yet, but 
         it's nice to see Andrew Miller MP getting the hang of it. 
         Andrew's currently proposing a Bill which would increase the 
         criminal penalty of copyright infringement from three years to 
         ten. No explanation as to why he thinks this is a good idea, 
         but Mr Miller is renowned for being the MP who believed 
         "people who oppose the [RIP] Bill are playing right into the 
         hands of some of the most evil criminals on this planet". One 
         to watch at the next election.

         LITERATURE (from 2.30pm, Sun 2001-04-08, Tate Modern, London,

         NOON (do they mean "scion"?), ROBERT COOVER (no idea) plus the 
         Berlin Linux User Group's FLORIAN CRAMER, and the whole thing

</span><span class="item">         So, we were hanging out with Bill Gates on Tuesday, and he 
         turns to us (and the other 3000 CHI2001 attendees at the 
         keynote) and says "We're pleased that 802.11b has become the 
         standard in wireless networks". Wooh, we think, mentally 
         noting to step over the corpse of Bluetooth as we leave, so 
         there's evil in 802.11 after all. Well, maybe the true 
         wickedness is that all those crazy community-owned, peer to 
         peer, dynamically routed, ad-hoc, IPv6-tastic roaming urban 
         network dreams that so filled the early 802.11 mailing lists 
         are grinding down into more realistic (but duller) plans for 
         centrally-maintained Access Points scattered over a few city 
         rooftops. Well, one last try: we still think that if someone 
         took a pre-existing ad-hoc routing code like MOBILEMESH and 
         bunged it together with some simple discovery tools and an 
         easy configuration utility, you could build a city-wide IBSS 
         network where *everyone's* machine acted as a router, where 
         the reach of the network naturally grew as more people joined 
         it, and the whole network would be so radically decentralised 
         that not even Bill could love it.

         NTK BESTSELLERS CHART now at <a href="http://www.ntk.net/books/">http://www.ntk.net/books/</a> . In 
         fact, with the possible exception of a surprise new entry by 
         THE KIDS FROM FAME SOUNDTRACK, it's pretty much business as 
         usual, with the Top 20 once again dominated by programming 
         manuals, literary classics and, of course, Neal Stephenson - 
         though, reassuringly, no-one seems to have advance-ordered

         despite the enticing information about how many pages it's 
         going to have. Also on the long-range scanner, TVGOHOME fans

         recommend the very-post-Watchmen POWERS COLOURING BOOK (UKP1) 
         <a href="http://www.jinxworld.com/powers.htm">http://www.jinxworld.com/powers.htm</a> and Warren Ellis' upcoming 
         MINISTRY OF SPACE, while questioning our omission of the DUNE 
         mini-series from our last pirate video review, as it's now 
         available on off-air US VHS transfers from "the right comic 
         fairs", if you know what we mean. Oddly, this new version 
         seems closer to the book, but isn't as good as the David Lynch 
         film (due to some truly otherworldly bad acting). Of course, 
         NTK condemns piracy should the offenders turn out to be big 
         companies like AOL; though sometimes it's tricky to sympathise 
         when the "victims" are the estate of noted libertarian Robert 
         A Heinlein and Harlan Ellison, who appears to have subtitled

         old publishing aphorism "Don't lay out every article in what 
         looks like giant 14-point Helvetica". And finally, a quick 
         snippet from the ever-vital world of the specialist press, 
         where PRESERVED BUS will, at last, be merging with BUS AND 
         COACH PRESERVATION from the issue dated June 2001. The new
