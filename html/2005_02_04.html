</span><span class="item">         Everyone else likes to worry about Google's gathering
         conflict of interests, but Verisign's S.P.E.C.T.R.E.-level
         skills still take some beating. This week, orbiting crypto
         analysts Ian Grigg and Adam Shostock belatedly pointed out 
         to ICANN that perhaps Verisign couldn't trusted with
         .net. Why? Well, Verisign these days offers both top level
         domains and SSL certificate authentication. They also, with
         their NetDiscovery service - sell ISPs a complete service for
         complying with law enforcement surveillance orders. So, if an
         American court demands an ISP wiretap its customers, and the
         ISP turns that order over to Verisign to do the dirty: well,
         Verisign can now fake any domain you want, and issue any
         temporary fake certificate, allowing even SSLed
         communications to be monitored. What's even more fun is that
         they are - at least in the US - now moving into providing
         infrastructure for mobile telephony. Yes, NOT EVEN YOUR 
         RINGTONES ARE SAFE.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Seems like yesterday when the anti-software-patents movement
         was being slighted for their confrontational approach.
         Impudent letters to MEPs? Railroading national parliaments
         to condemn their own commissioner's railroading of the patent
         directive? Real, live, protests in Brussels? These are not
         the subtle negotiations of which the EU is enamoured. It 
         worked though: against all the odds, the software patent
         process was hard-reset this week. Now it all starts again:
         and with groups like the FFII, for better or worse, taken
         much more seriously this time. Plus, it looks like Microsoft
         has taken a leaf from the free software protesters' book.
         Rather than simply lie down and take the EU's forced
         unbundling of Windows and its media player, Microsoft have
         cheekily named their new, legal, software "Windows XP:
         Reduced Media Edition". We're thinking "Windows XP: Suck My
         Pastel-Coloured Balls, Euroweenies" might have been mildly
         more confrontational, but only just. And wll it work?  Angry
         citizens are one thing; petulant, sulking, multinationals are
         distinctly less ennobling.

         BLOG AWARD, whose closing date, we are assured, is now next 
         Monday 2005-02-07, and whose entry fee (for the blog category

         from Feb 24) - a similarly contemporary take on the ancient 
         legend from the fertile mind of Rich "Lee And" Herring who, it 
         must be said, has shown considerable dedication to the actor's

         library that can spit out native-code, cross-platform apps
         for Palms, WindowsCE, desktop machines - and now, with
         version 5.0, Symbian phones. It's for people who can't quite
         bring themselves to use J2ME and its policy of "ooh I don't
         think a little mobily thing like you should be trying big
         boy work like that do you?". This version also marks a
         change in their business model, which involves commercial
         folk paying a license for a LGPL'd version. Free peoples can
         use the GPLd SuperWaba for free just fine. You can tell this
         has something to do with business models and commercial
         respectability, because the new corporate-looking website is
         unnavigable, and tells you nothing about the software. Ah

       ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/spongebobsquarepants04.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/spongebobsquarepants04.htm</a> :
         Patrick portraying sadomasochism; best friends SpongeBob and 
         Patrick were the only ones in the show to flash bare 
         backsides; two other characters [...] were noted gleefully 
         rubbing their posteriors together but at least they were 
         clothed)... the gag about one of the actors playing themselves 
         is possibly the only original bit in extended David Holmes 
         video/ modern-day "Pink Panther" retread OCEAN'S TWELVE (imdb: 
         rome/ heist/ amsterdam/ sequel/ criminal-gang/ thief/ sequel-
         to-remake/ train)... otherwise half-term is traditionally 
         commemorated by a load of talking animals - oh and adolescent

         ( <a href="http://www.screenit.com/movies/2004/first_daughter.html">http://www.screenit.com/movies/2004/first_daughter.html</a> : 
         We see [Katie "Dawson's Creek" Holmes] in some sexy-looking 
         pajamas; We see [her] in small shorts, a low-cut top that 
         shows cleavage, high-heeled boots and a blonde wig. After 
         drinking too much, she gets up on a bar's runway and starts 
         doing some sexy dance moves)...
