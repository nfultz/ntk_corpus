</span><span class="item">         It was only a matter of time before requests to "whois
         internic.net" met with the reply: "We're NETWORK SOLUTIONS.
         Who the hell are you?". This week, NSI did the next best
         thing. Visitors to the previously neutral (and useful)
         Internic site were redirected to networksolutions.com, NSI's
         commercial site - not at all the sort of thing that Eugene
         Kashpureff faced 5 years' jail for [NTK 1997-11-07].
         Remarkably, the usual locations for ftp'ing registration
         forms, accessing the whois server, and generally doing
         anything useful without paying for the nose for it, vanished.
         Reactions from the sysadmins on NANOG list were predictably
         withering: given that the Internic was a US government
         trademark, suggested one, couldn't they sue NetSol for domain
         squatting? And if this is what they do when they're being
         public-spirited, imagine what they're going to be like when
         their monopoly ends, and they're going to have to start
         *competing*.

</span><span class="item">         We could probably grab some much needed kudos from *not* being
         invited to Monday's closed-doors meeting between civil rights
         campaigners and ISP orgs - given the LINX's rather pointed
         comments in the invite about unhelpful muck-raking
         journalists. Sadly, we *were* invited, but overslept. The
         deliberations were covered by "Chatham House Rules"
         (translation: we'd have to append "but I couldn't possibly
         comment" to every quote people sent us), but we *can* report
         that it seemed a darn sight friendlier than the next day's
         SCRAMBLING FOR SAFETY. There, the annual DTI Spokesman Gets
         Chewed Up And Spat Out competition smashed even previous
         year's records, and various mauled civil servants broke with
         tradition to say that it *wasn't* their fault that the crypto
         proposals were late/wrong/deluded or mad. No, it was everyone
         else's fault for whinging too much. And they're not late/
         wrong/deluded/mad, they're just "under consultation", and thus
         eminently fixable. Until next week, that is, when the April
         1st deadline passes, and the government representatives begin
         an entirely new phase of going "Wah Wah Wah! Not listening!"

         band AOL GIRLS - currently pursued by America Online for
         inadvertently appropriating their subscribers' popular search
         term (and clarion mating call?). After all, both The Guardian
         and BBC Online were convinced that the Girls' $9.95 monthly
         membership ("discreetly appears" on your credit-card statement
         as "DMR") offers merely "Exclusive Pics" and "Saucy Secrets",
         rather than, say, some dodgy porn scam. However: a quick visit
         to "Dr whois" shows aol-girls.com is owned by obvious domain
         speculators photoagency.com - also behind adolfhitler.com,
         18andnew.com, nazigirl.com - while AltaVista reveals the
         Stalin-esque "disappearance" of three previous members,
         apparently after "animal sex", "big tits", and "nasa starcraft

         promise of bring-your-own-PC party INSOMNIA '99 (from 9am Fri
         today, in an "old Army theatre" outside Bicester Army Base,
         UKP40): not just Quake 2 but also Starcraft, Quake World, and
         Total Annihilation - a bit like a Scandinavian demo party but
         without all that late-night video projection and last-
         minute coding nonsense. Speaking of which, Norway's THE
         GATHERING (from Wed 1999-03-31, The Viking Ship, Hamar, NOK
         425) is of course the real thing: 5 full days of Quake, Quake
         2, Half Life and Starcraft leavened with the very cutting
         edge of Amiga / Commodore 64 / BeBox apologists. Insomnia has
         a bar, alcohol is forbidden at The Gathering ("We don't have
         any minimum age requirements, but we expect attendees to be
         able to feed themselves"); both ban "water boiling equipment"
         so nor will you be able to survive on melted snow. Hell, go

         COOL", gushes our favourite browserwatcher about the new
         "dogfood-ready" Mozilla release, SeaMonkey. The work-in-
         progress browser from Netscape is *just* about usable, and
         beta-victims everywhere now have a smashing new opportunity
         to crash their machines in the pursuit of open source quality
         control. Is it worth it? Well, our correspondent writes: "It
         took me five minutes to work out how to add a button with my
         face on it to the main toolbar. I guess you can do a lot of
         this customisation stuff with IE5 .hta's as well. BUT THEY'RE
         NOT AS COOL." Further fun lies in writing informative yet
         bitingly sarcastic bug reports to Bugzilla, especially when
         you get e-mails back with Netscape's engineers equally bitchy
         comments appended. Now *you* could "be" jwz!

         obsessive 350 mile walk in a (largely) straight line,
         helpfully titled AS THE CROW FLIES (8pm, Fri, BBC2)... Steven
         "Press Gang" Moffat wrote this MURDER MOST HORRID (9pm, Fri,
         BBC2), which may make Dawn French's constant mugging more
         tolerable... and following When Eagles Dare three weeks ago,
         Friday is Eastwood WW2 night again with zany tank heist caper
         KELLY'S HEROES (10.30pm, Fri, BBC1)... oh, cruel fate that
         saw Kubrick die merely *weeks* before a major BBC2
         retrospective of his work: in particular, DR STRANGELOVE
         (10.35pm, Sat, BBC2) hasn't been on terrestrial since the far-
         off days of last November... anyone who didn't get the
         "SkyNet" gags in NTK 1999-03-05 is advised to pay attention
         this time to THE TERMINATOR (9.05pm, Sat, ITV)... DEADLY
         INVASION: THE KILLER BEE NIGHTMARE (9pm, Sat, C5) isn't a
         sensational "When Insects Attack" docu but just the start of
         many dreadful looking monster movies - culminating in non-
         Alan-Moore Heather Locklear GMO parable THE RETURN OF SWAMP
         THING (9.55pm, Sun, C5)... and no wonder Arlington Road's
         Jeff Bridges is paranoid after Tommy Lee Jones's Mousetrap-
         inspired IRA bombs leave him feeling BLOWN AWAY (12midnight,
         Sat, ITV)... Sandra Bullock's THE NET (10pm, Sun, C4) creates
         a more convincing sense of social isolation than it does of
         lethal hacker-viruses - largely by not casting any other
         characters... post-Reboot CGI romp SHADOW RAIDERS (nee "War
         Planets") shows twice every day this week (10am; 4.30pm, Mon-
         Fri, SkyOne)... and god, not the rubbish Abel Ferrara version
         of BODY SNATCHERS *again* (10pm, Mon, C4)... psychic animals
         rescue humans, redecorate each other's homes in predictable
         cross-genre combination SUPERNATURAL (8.30pm, Tue, BBC1)...
         remember the '70s? weren't they *hilarious?* inquires hideous
         New Romantic comedy HUNTING VENUS (9pm, Wed, ITV) - unlikely
         to touch those excellent TOP TENS (9.30pm, Sat, C4)... while
         mock-French restaurant chain Pierre Victoire's appearance on
         TROUBLE AT THE TOP (9.30pm, Wed, BBC2) confirms suspicions of
         diners who thought their "3 course meal for 5.95" offer was
         slightly too good to be true...
         
</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; of course, cuddly monster movie MIGHTY JOE (MPAA:
         Rated PG for some menacing action violence and mild language)
         really does need a surname to avoid confusion with MEET JOE
         [BLACK] - see NTK 1999-03-19 (the largely appalling CineZine
         argues Joe shouldn't be forced to use the "slave name" of his
         human "wife", Charlize "2 Days In The Valley" Theron)...
         whatever the X stands for in vicious message-heavy Romper-
         Stomper-inspired skinhead saga AMERICAN HISTORY X (imdb:
         based-on-novel / neo-nazism / racism / white-supremacists),
         it doesn't seem to be the removed credit of director Tony
         Kaye (and no, you don't need to have seen American History I-
         IX to understand it)... those who prefer their violence a
         little more morally motivated should cheer Mel Gibson's semi-
         comic table-turning Point Blank-remake PAYBACK (imdb: robbery
         / money / narrative / revenge / doublecross / based-on-novel
         / prostitution / black-comedy / twist-in-the-end / pickpocket
         / blood / s&amp;m / drugs / crooked / organized-crime /
         kidnapping / torture) - re-teams Mel with Conspiracy Theory/
         LA Confidential writer Brian Helgeland (who Mel then fired),
         plus Deborah Kara Unger from "The Game"... NTK's pre-school
         readers will know that nappy-filling golden shower THE
         RUGRATS MOVIE (imdb: based-on-tv-series / kids-and-family /
         sequel) picks up from the end of season 7 cliffhanger to
         extend many of the major plot arcs previously raised in the
         Rugrats "mythos" - but is it showing with the "CatDog" short
         as seen on US screens?... and no Oscars but plenty of
         exposure for more gay, less camp version of "Ed Wood" GODS
         AND MONSTERS (imdb: not to be confused with "The Crow 3:
         World of Gods and Monsters") - a more sensitive look at
         horror films and unrequited love than the same director's
         "Candyman II: Farewell to the Flesh"...
         
         MUSICAL THEATRE [WITH YOUR HOST, THE "BUTCHER OF BROADBAND",
         CHARLIE BROOKER] - Review of Virus The Musical, as requested
         in NTK 1999-03-05: SAM FOX was "indisposed" and replaced by
         her understudy. JACK WILD - Artful Dodger in the 1968 movie
         of "Oliver!" - plays a mouse. He has to wear a costume with
         two buttons on his chest. His arse is the rollerball. He does
         a little jig and sings a song called "Double Click". There's
         another song called "You're Going To Get Your Interface
         Kicked In" and a touching sequence in which a 3.5" floppy
         sings of her unrequited love for a hard drive... in one early
         scene, a character explains the advantages of file
         compression; adult dancers in silver catsuits ("files") climb
         into a mysterious box-like machine, and reappear through a
         hole in the base - as children. "FILE MANAGER" and his
         cronies go on to sing about the joys of conserving hard disk
         space. By this point I was slack-jawed with astonishment,
         like someone watching the opening sequence of Saving Private
         Ryan for the first time... the programme includes a glossary
         of computer terms "for the unsure, the uninitiated, and
         parents", and peppered with typos ("countrys", "Chernobyll",
         "beetamax", "miniturized"). I sat in on a matinee and was
         surrounded by schoolchildren who seemed to be enjoying
         themselves. Still, they were probably all on crack or
         something... to cap off the weirdness, it's all being backed
         by LEE TAYLOR-RYAN, the guy who won 6.5m on the lottery, then
         had to serve time for dealing in stolen cars. He was
         apparently so impressed by the cast's "will to succeed" that
         he agreed to save the show from financial apocalypse. There
         is currently no news of their planned "national tour"...
