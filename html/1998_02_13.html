</span><span class="item">         Maybe if they knew more about encrypting their e-mails,
         there wouldn't be so many leaks about this. Yes, it sounds
         like the British government really are going to choose the
         path of maximum stupidity and announce a KEY ESCROW POLICY
         in the next couple of weeks. Without getting too technical
         (as if we would), this is ... a bad thing. Bad for civil
         liberties, bad for business. It will be as if you'll be
         forced to loan someone else your PIN, or your signature.
         Britain's booming crypto industries - particularly the ones
         being eyed up by Bill Gates in Cambridge - will be zapped
         at birth. At worst - if key escrow is made mandatory -
         you'll be criminalised simply for owning a copy of Pretty
         Good Privacy, while the real outlaws will simply move onto
         undetectable crypto systems. Almost all the security
         experts are against it - all, except the ones at GCHQ, who
         rather like the idea of being able to break into anyone's
         private communications at the drop of a hat. "Attempts to
         control the use of encryption technology are wrong in
         principle, unworkable in practice, and damaging to the
         long-term economic value of the information networks.",
         said the Labour Party's manifesto, signed and pledged by
         Tony Blair himself. Or perhaps he gave away his signature
         for someone else to use? Gosh, wouldn't *that* be a
         terrible thing to happen?

         NTK's favourite crypto expert, Ross Anderson, has been hard
         at work, as the WASHINGTON POST - somewhat inaccurately -
         reported this week. After giving a $20 million grant by
         Microsoft to his Cambridge department, Bill asked Ross and
         his team to see if they couldn't invent an unbreakable
         copy-protection system. Taking advantage of their studies
         into TEMPEST technologies (readily available spy equipment
         that lets anyone see what's on your monitor from outside
         your building), the group suggested a method that would
         broadcast license numbers via the VDU, so that special
         "Microsoft software piracy vans" could drive around and
         scan buildings for unregistered software. Strangely,
         Microsoft weren't so keen on this. No matter. As part of
         the same study, Ross' group went on to develop a method for
         protecting *any* user from covert surveillance by using a
         special "anti-Tempest" font. A problem solved, before you
         even knew it was there...

</span><span class="item">         It looks like INTEL'S StrongARM tactics didn't quite come
         off as expected. Many commentators thought that Intel would
         be happy to keep the plucky British processor going when
         the company bought it in a job lot with a bunch of chip
         fabrication plants from Digital. But the team who actually
         developed the processor have now all jumped ship to a cushy
         consultancy afterlife at Cadence. Whether they did this out
         of anti-Intel sentiment(come on, these are ARM users -
         they're *all* religious fanatics), or just because they
         could sense a distinct lack of a "to do" list in their
         future Psion diaries at Intel is uncertain. But most
         pundits now agree that, what with ARM owning the trademark,
         Intel owning the Hudson chip plant, and Cadence owning the
         brains, StrongARM development is on the road to nowhere. Us
         - we still hold out hope. After all, the Beatles reformed
         didn't they? Oh, ah. Maybe that's a bad comparison.

         much put-upon Webcasting guru, GAVIN STARKS,is appearing in
         a "multi-media entertainment", MORE, at the Gate Theatre on
         Wednesday 18/2/98. He'll be premiering his new computer-
         generated musical composition. Your geek attractor: it
         really is computer generated, via approximately 9,000 lines
         of C++ and 3 gigs of collected audio data. Gavin says to
         say "frequency-domain morphing". Tickets are UKP5, show
         starts at 7.30PM. Box office: 0171 995 6035.
         Meanwhile, fans of TV'S LIGHT LUNCH might like to pop down
         to a VALENTINE'S CABARET on Sunday 15/2/98, where those
         Aphrodites of daytime TV, SUE PERKINS AND MEL GIEDROYC,
         will be entertaining the troops, assisted by Venus the
         Goddess of Love, R.D. Laing and usual Special Project
         suspects. Tickets are UKP10. The show starts at 7.30pm at
         the October Gallery, Old Gloucester Road, near Russell

         imports of its own: Mad-About-Phoebe cute-fest DHARMA AND
         GREG (10.30pm, Fri, LWT + regions), and eyeless Dilbert-
         alike THE DREW CAREY SHOW (11.40pm, Mon, ITV)... isn't
         there actually a Red Dwarf episode where the crew are
         forced to sit down and watch nearly three hours of
         themselves on RED DWARF NIGHT (9pm, Sat, BBC2) - surreally
         introduced by Jean-Luc Picard and Stephen Hawking? well, if
         there isn't, there should be... LWT "celebrates"
         Valentine's Day with a very special movie double-bill: Meg
         Ryan alcoholism tragedy WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN (9pm, Sat,
         LWT) and adulterous Gene Wilder comedy THE WOMAN IN RED
         (11.25pm, Sat, LWT) - and, before you ask, no, neither of
         them are anything like the songs...
         <a href="http://mudhole.spodnet.uk.com/fist/">http://mudhole.spodnet.uk.com/fist/</a> will tell you far more
         about LEE AND HERRING IN THIS MORNING WITH RICHARD NOT JUDY
         (12.15pm, Sun, BBC2) than we could ever dare to (NB: it's
         also repeated - in sinisterly "revised" form - later next
         Fri)... not entirely clear what the "extreme" in the new,
         animated EXTREME GHOSTBUSTERS (4.15pm, Tue, ITV) refers to
         - though one is vaguely Hispanic, one rides a wheelchair,
         and the only remaining member of the original cast (Egon -
         Slimer doesn't count) is now mysteriously blonde...
         PREDATOR 2 (10.40pm, Wed, Carlton + regions) is that rare
         sequel that's almost as good as the original, though surely
         a couple of snipers would have sorted it out a bit
         quicker... and it's a (repeated) flashback to the
         surprisingly good "One With The Flashback" when Janice asks
         if any of the gang were ever more than just FRIENDS
         (10.30pm, Wed, C4)...

         alternate-dimension / based-on-video-game / fantasy /
         transformation / game / martial-arts) - if only because the

         rating for "non-stop martial arts violence", thus, once
         again, confusing certification with recommendation...
         otherwise a good week for fans of Brit-made whimsy

         photography / family / drama / fairy-tale / fantasy /
         period), plus DOWNTIME (imdb: thriller), which scores
         points for setting a gritty social-comment action movie *in
         a lift!*, but then plummets weirdly out of control...
         sadly, the I/O configuration of popular hardware platforms
         are not the subject matter of IN AND OUT (imdb: school-

         it's actually an extended rework of the "gay" Seinfeld
         episode, though - in this case - there *is* something wrong
         with that... oh, and the Motion Picture Association of
         America don't yet seem to have made it through a showing of
         SICK: THE LIFE AND DEATH OF BOB FLANAGAN, SUPERMASOCHIST

         the lines of "You know **** Digital? Going bust. And ***
         Networks? They're toilet-bound too, you know". When we get
         these, we're torn. Should we print them, and risk really
         annoying the supposedly-doomed companies? What if they sue
         us? What if they're not as weak as the tipster claims, and
         they come around and kick us in?
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         On the other hand (this being the booming world of plucky
         UK start-ups), our tipsters are almost always right. It
         seems a shame not to give such perspicacious souls credit.
         To cope with this, we're introducing a new NTK feature.
         Simply send us, now, a list of companies that you think are
         going to go bust in the next year. When they *do* go bust,
         we'll announce it - as ever - in Anti-News, but follow it
         with a FALCO!, together with the names of those who
         successfully predicted their demise. So, for instance, we
         might say "Intel calls in receiver (Davy Winder, Vint Cerf
         - FALCO!)". You can, of course, choose to remain anonymous.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         The Falco competition is so named in honour of Falco, the
         prominent Austria techno-rap artist, who passed away
         earlier this week. The winner of the most FALCO!s by the
         time we do the .NOT Awards (almost there now), will receive
         our special commemorative "Rock of Amadeus" statuette. You
         may nominate up to five technology-based companies. You can
         change your list whenever you see a FALCO! in NTK. We
         reserve the right to abandon this competition if it turns
         out not to be funny, but actually a bit sick. Or too much
         like hard work.
