         fancy buildings around South Kensington (continues until
         2000-09-30). At time of going to press, tickets were still
         available to see novelist Stephen Baxter and Blur
         bass-player Alex James discussing Mars (7.30pm, tonight)
         while, on Tue, you can pay 12 quid to hear Richard Dawkins
         reading from his own books, accompanied by "actress and
         artist" Lalla Ward who, for some reason, the site neglects
         to point out, is perhaps best known as "the second Romana"
         from Dr Who.

         consumer electronics jamboree LIVE 2000 (from Thu
         2000-09-21, Earls Court, London), an event unashamedly aimed
         at readers of the ever-popular publishing genre "this
         attractive young woman on the cover has nothing to do with
         the gadget she's holding". Promising "the latest, sexiest
         kit" ("I don't know how I survived without a WAP phone!",
         says the show's spokeswoman, apparently called Kit), the
         site immediately blows it with a contest to win a Sony
         Memory Stick Walkman featuring "a robust copyright
         protection system" - like *that's* some kind of incentive!

</span><span class="item">         The embarassing thing about everyone shifting over to the
         slim GNOME wraparound of Mozilla, GALEON, is that MOZILLA
         itself is finally becoming usable. The new Netscape skin is
         tolerable, there have been leaps in its lizardly speed,
         memory shag is decreasing, and the bugcount looks to be
         finally contained (we think: the Bugzilla chart-drawing page
         broke some time back, ironically). But who cares about that,
         when there's an even *titchier* wraparound for the 10MB
         Mozilla binary. SKIPSTONE spurns all those GNOME libraries
         that Galeon revels in, and remains a raw GTK app that you
         can compile on anything that's got the Moz libraries hanging
         around. It's still relatively cruddy compared to Galeon
         (which is getting damn near to an everyday browser), but we
         like the way it fobs off the downloading to 'wget'. And the
         fact it's only 57K. And that it's already in Debian's
         unstable distribution.

         geek-fest TWISTER (9pm, Fri, ITV) - scripted by Michael
         Crichton and his wife Anne-Marie Martin, formerly the lovely
         assistant to "Sledge Hammer"... the Crichton theme-park re-
         opens later the same night with Westworld sequel FUTUREWORLD
         (1.30am, Fri, ITV) - oh, the hubris of man and his never-
         ending quest for "progress"... a motif continued in what seems
         to be a new run of TEAM KNIGHT RIDER (4.05pm, Sat, ITV), the
         increasingly surreal impersonations of CELEBRITY STARS IN
         THEIR EYES (7.20pm, Sat, ITV), and the triumph of schlocky

         original event lasted about 5 years, it's *always* some sort
         of WW2 ANNIVERSARY (from 10.30am, Sun, BBC2)... thank heavens
         the title explains MY NAME IS JOE (11pm, Sun, C4) because the

         Jean-Claude Van Damme battles himself once again in TIMECOP
         (10pm, Mon, BBC1) - last shown August 1999 ... "not as good as

         response to our exciting website redesign has been
         overwhelmingly negative, with a lone voice ("FWIW *Love* the
         new look!") swiftly drowned out by a combination of ALAN
         CONNOR ("I think I'll find it 'virtually unreadable' and
         suggest 'you may as well go and write for Wired or
         something'"); PETER J SMITH ("OK apart from the BODY tag which
         uses marginwidth and marginheight instead of leftmargin and
         topmargin"); and, of course, a hail of invective from self-
         appointed compliance officer LLOYD WOOD, who slammed us for
         *not* having changed many of the expiry date, doctype and
         table problems he first pointed out in Christmas 1997. It's
         heart-warming pedantry from readers like this that really
         makes doing NTK worthwhile - keep it coming!... thanks to all
         of you who submitted your own suggestions for the Kabalarian's
         "Choose The Ideal Name For Your Child" generator [NTK 2000-08-

         Evil" was prompted by numerous responses to the same issue's
         <a href="http://www.portalofevil.com/eatme.shtml">http://www.portalofevil.com/eatme.shtml</a> link to politely
         inquire "You guys know we are just playing over at POE, right?
         Some of your countrymen have sent me some crazy misguided
         emails, what can I say... I am bound to respond publicly".
         Hey, c'mon Chet - maybe they're just "playing" too? Where's
         that famous American sense of humour?... NICOLA PEARCE, after
         reading NTK 2000-08-04, claimed she'd "have to wash [her] hard
         disk out with soap and water. First we have a German guy being
         Hitler. Then we have the BNP. And lastly we have Rec.Guns.
         Have you been infiltrated by gun-worshipping fascists?" Ho ho
         Nicola, of course not - links from NTK, particularly to
         extremists such as the BNP, or Mac users, are often satirical
         in intent and should not be taken as endorsements. You should
         see the links we *don't* run, like this charmingly Freudian
         refugee from alt.sex.stories.catfights.sex.with.your.mother :

         finally, to the anonymous tipster who commented "Why have you
         taken to saying 'fricking' you fucking pussies? Cancel my
         subscription etc", can you please supply quantitative evidence
