</span><span class="item">         Any sufficiently opaque process on the Net eventually gets
         described as "weather". This week a hurricane hit the
         rankings of Google search terms. Every month, Google tweaks
         its algorithms and reloads its database, shuffling sites
         into a new world order in a move known to those who care as
         the "Google Dance". This month, though, the music was
         particularly thrash metal. Long-time top-rankers plummetted
         from the front page of search results into the far hellish
         reaches of "oooogle". It hit bloggers, whose
         hyperlink-o-hypertrophia had previously made them Google's
         kingmakers. And it hit the Search Engine Optimisers, whose
         voodoo schemes to make you - yes, you, Widget Maker of Iowa,
         #1 ranking for "+sex +iowa" - were sorely screwed by
         plummeting rankings. More importantly though - anecdotal
         evidence suggest that search results for ordinary users seem
         to be a bit off, too. Broken sites, obvious spams, and
         irrelevant sites are dotting people's first hits. Of course,
         anecdotes don't count for jack: but now that Google has
         gathered so much power, and moves in such mysterious ways,
         conjecture's all that's left. We mortals can just sit and
         watch the clouds gather. Who knows what Google wrought?

</span><span class="item">         In what we assume isn't a "Faking IT"-style scheme to turn a
         Linux sysadmin into a contemporary digital artist, Sheffield's
         REDUNDANT TECHNOLOGY INITIATIVE are seeking applications for a
         two-week (paid!) residency this November at their attractive
         Access Space free media lab, ideally making use of their
         extensive stocks of recycled/reclaimed "redundant" technology
         and open source software. You'd have to run a workshop,
         presentation and online diary about what you've created during
         that space of time, but other than that, they sound amazingly
         open-minded about what you could have a go at. Deadline for
         applications is next Friday 2002-10-11, mail <a href="mailto:tamar@lowtech.org">tamar@lowtech.org</a>
         for further info - and, if you are lucky enough to be chosen,
         maybe you could stick a couple of updates on their website,
         assuming they give you access to the servers and you have a
         spare moment or two.

          - those "Elite" t-shirt royalties clearly going to good use
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Like Seinfeld says: "There's no way that moving in with your
         parents is a sign that your life is right on track... Yeah,
         things are going great, I've met a terrific girl, I've got a
         great job, I'm making a lot of money and, if everything goes
         according to plan, I'm going to be moving back in with my
         parents". However, let us emphasise that there are entirely
         sensible reasons for THE REGISTER to leave their prestigious
         central London office address, as happened this week, and
         (temporarily) operate as a "virtual" workplace from various
         safehouses dotted around the country. First of all, the lease
         was up; the landlord wants to convert the office into flats or
         somesuch; and we imagine the rent for 20-22 Maddox Street, in
         the heart of London's fashionable Mayfair, was really quite
         something. But put away your concerns over "the end of an era"
         and potential impact on the local economy - rest assured that
         the team will now officially be carrying out their most
         important business from pubs in the area, instead of it
         sometimes just seeming that way.

</span><span class="item">         CAMELBONES, Sherm Pendley's Perl to Cocoa bridge for MacOS
         X, has all the looks of a standard sourceforge project:
         half-written website written in barebones HTML, low version
         numbers, couple of unmarked downloads. Install it, though,
         and it's another story. Tight integration with the Mac's
         Project Builder, ridiculously complete API support - it's an
         amazing piece of work that's fast becoming the official Perl
         environment for the running-dog turncoat Switchers of the
         Unix world. Dan "Stakhanovite of Perl" Sugalski is writing a
         book on it, even Apple have been heard to recommend it.
         About the only thing it's missing is sub-classing, which
         Thank The Lord, just isn't the big deal in Objective C that
         it is in other, more crack-inspired OOP languages. Rumour
         has it that this will be fixed in 0.3, due in November. That
         is, unless Jobs is planning to have Sherm killed beforehand,
         for being Too Clever Outside The Cupertino Campus.

         RUNAWAY BRIDE (8.30pm, ITV, BBC1) against new BBC pop search

         weekend with Liz Hurley hilarity PASSENGER 57 (9pm, Fri, C5),
         John Woo misfire HARD TARGET (11pm, Fri, BBC1), and Armstrong

         hillbilly nipple-taping surrealism-fest GUMMO (2.25am, Fri,

         "Nigger" in THE DAM BUSTERS (3pm, Sun, ITV) this time around:

         presented by Big Brother producer Peter Bazalgette as a

         Bazalgette - hopefully introduced by the continuity announcer

         heroin dealing in SWEET SIXTEEN ( <a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/">http://www.bbfc.co.uk/</a> :

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CONFECTIONERY THEORY&gt;&gt; so we finally get our hands on sugar-
         free fruity apostrophes STARBURST FRUITINESSE (from 49p), only
         to discover that if you hand them out at parties, the flip-top
         plastic tube makes people assume they're some kind of drugs.
         That said, the blackcurrant/ strawberry/ mandarin/ apple
         flavours do indeed "Wake up your mouth", causing reader JAMES
         CRONIN to ponder if they were intended as "a rival" to WONKA
         NERDS? Other non-disappointments include white chocolate's
         most sophisticated incarnation yet, CADBURY DREAM SNOW BITES
         ("White chocolate with a whipped mousse centre containing
         honeycombed pieces"), but CADBURY MYE ("Whipped cream flavour
         mousse and roasted cocoa nib truffle centre") was just pipped
         at the post for this month's accolade of "Taste Abomination"
         by the new green-foil-packaging CADBURY BOOST WITH GLUCOSE AND
         GUARANA, nominated by RICHARD CHENG for combining the old
         Boost experience with "a nasty fake cherry flavour and a
         slightly bitter aftertaste". Though an honourable mention goes
         to BENDICKS for their boxed twist-wrap "Milk, dark, white &amp;
         marbled chocolates with a hint of mint", to which they've
         given the truly terrible name of MINGLES... over in drinks 'n'
         savouries, there does appear to be a thin, but genuine, non-
         reprocessed slice of meat in the MCDONALDS STEAK PREMIERE
         SANDWICH (from around UKP2.49), yet the abuse continues to
         flood in for DIET COKE LEMON ("like drinking ordinary coke
         through a Kentucky Fried Chicken Handwipe" - STEF MAGDALINSKI)
         - does no-one have any similar complaints over PEPSI LEMON
         TWIST? And our sympathies to JAMES HINCHLIFFE, who found the
         resemblance of STREAKY BACON QUAVERS to "the flayed hide of
         Bagpuss" both "uncanny" and "distressing" - and leaving what
         they actually taste like to our fevered imaginations... on the
         international scene, DAN BURGESS recommended ALTOIDS CITRUS
         SOURS ("truly delightful breath mints that I have only seen in
         Pennsylvania this summer"), but there's still plenty of fun
         stuff to look out for over here, as CADBURY take on MCVITIES
         MUNCH BITES with their own range of pocket-sized MIGHTY MINIS.
         But "hot and spicy" is the real theme of autumn, with SPICY
         COCKTAIL AIRWAVES GUM, PEPPARAMI MINICHEDDARS, MCCAIN HOT
         CRISPS (which you cook in the microwave), plus the long-
         awaited return of last year's limited edition MONSTER MUNCH
         which turned your mouth blue [NTK 2001-09-07] - the innovation
         being that it now turns it blue or green, and you have to
         stick your tongue out to find out which. It's called the
         "Mystery Tongue" Monster Munch variant - what else?...
