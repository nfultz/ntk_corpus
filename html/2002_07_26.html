</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         A public fight between former partners spills onto a Web
         forum - with accusations of poor hygiene, two-timing, and
         sex with goats. Well, even without that last one, the REDBUS
         vs REDBUS INTERHOUSE spat still promises to be the best
         online tussle this side of Watford FC. In the red corner:
         the directors of colocation corp Interhouse, the first and
         dearest of Cliff Stanford's startup firms after flogging
         Demon. In the redder corner - Cliff Stanford himself, trying
         to regain control after being unceremoniously squeezed off
         the board a few weeks back. Net veteran that he is, Cliff's
         revenge involves brushing off the forum software, kicking up
         the HTML, and spooling his side of the story to the
         shareholders on his Website. The punters, unused to this
         degree of corporate transparency, have been peppering him
         with questions - including at one stage requesting (and
         getting) a detailed breakdown of Cliff's use of the Redbus
         private jet. The incumbent board are a bit more taciturn.
         But even Bo Bendtsen, founder of cheapo webhosting co
         UK2.NET and newly minted Interhouse company director, has
         been popping in to fend off Cliff's criticisms. And
         stumbling, it appears, right into the paths of other
         Interhouse customers, less than happy to see the owner of a
         competing hosting company take an executive role in their
         coloc. That said, Bo's no stranger to BBSs: shame we've yet
         to see any of his old friends from the FidoNet days post
         their opinions.

</span><span class="item">         Still, it's not all pain and strife. To rollback through a
         few bits of good news from previous weeks: Yahoo turned off
         their medieval -&gt; medireview autoconverter, depriving the
         English language of another synonym for "old and busted";
         the JPEG committee has, like our anonymous contact, also
         spotted Lucent pursuing patent claims on JPEG/JBIG codes,
         and is pursuing it. And, going back a bit further, you may
         remember ROSS ANDERSON getting het up about the UK Export
         Bill, which would have placed export bans on a bunch of
         dangerous items, including some ideas and code. After five
         months of lobbying, Ross and his cohorts this week got the
         government to include an amendment that excludes scientific
         research, material being published, and work in the public
         domain. Which means you can still write letters about crypto
         to your friends outside .uk without being convicted of
         thoughtcrime and ten years in jail. Truly a week in which
         things got worse slower!

</span><span class="item">         Bram Cohen, the flaxen-haired hacker behind CodeCon, has
         been beavering away on BITTORRENT, his P2P obsession,
         fulltime and unpaid, for eight months. It's nearly ready to
         ship at DEFCON next week, but it needs a mite more testing.
         But there's a problem: how *do* you stress test a "swarming
         downloader"? BitTorrent's a helper app that's designed to
         allow servers to redistribute the download burden of
         slashdottings amongst the audience. Download a big
         BitTorrent-enabled file, and you'll simultaneously upload
         chunks to your fellow downloaders. It's a nice practical
         application of P2P. Except how do you simulate a
         slashdotting? Especially when you've already shrugged off
         one bona fide, slashdot.org appearence? Cohen sensibly
         thought of two words here: free pr0n. So he's got a 700meg
         porn file on his site he'd like you all to download. All of
         you. Preferably at the same time. If you're curious about
         network scaling issues, realworld Python applications, or
         you're just filthy, follow the link below. Preferably within
         a few minutes of getting this mail. You can always delete
         the file after you're done - hell, with production values
         like this, and copyright laws like that, it'd probably be
         best if you did. And maybe best if you didn't do this at work.

         Andrew MacKay, best known as "The Professor" from pub landlord 
         sitcom "Time Gentlemen Please", "Pie Man" from "Lee And 
         Herring's Fist Of Fun", and a former "Michael Faraday" (and, 
         we think, "Nikola Tesla") at the Science Museum.

</span><span class="item">         The problem with chart-drawing programs is the same as their
         big brothers, presentation programs: the more powerful they
         are, the more of your precious life you spend tweaking. At
         what angle and shade of puce, I wonder, should my 3D
         pyramidical scattergram of our accounting discrepancies over
         time be? Sometimes you just want a barchart. Well, for
         simple-living Unix folk, old PLOTICUS may be the answer.
         PLOTICUS takes in data and config info on the command line,
         wipes its hands on its denim overalls, and belches a
         barchart (or linechart, or scatter graph, or whatever) in
         SVG, PS, PNG or somesuch. It's been around for years. It
         isn't in Java or PHP, and doesn't use XML. When things go
         wrong, it doesn't raise an exception, it segfaults. The
         built-in scripting language looks like something you wrote
         that time, drunk. But most data sources can be shovelled
         into it with a bit of Perl massage, and there's a great big
         pile of built-in (and hackable) scripts that cover most
         eventualities, and you want a quick-and-dirty chart of your
         logfile? It's yours. And if you want baroque, you know where
         the PowerPoint is kept.
