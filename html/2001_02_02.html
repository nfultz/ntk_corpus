</span><span class="item">         Despite support by such legal heavyweights as CAROL
         VORDERMAN and ZDNET NEWS, an amendment to permit entrapment
         of suspected online chat crims didn't pass muster in the
         Lords this Wednesday - possibly because it'd have breached
         Article 6 of that pesky EuroConventionoHumanoRightso. But
         who needs laws when the febrile Interweb permits all? To a
         paranoid eye, everything online was a trap this week. Take
         the boast by 192.com that they'd bought half of THE BIG
         BREACH's first printing, and were set on distributing it to
         their 650,000 users. Very laudable: except wasn't it 192.com
         who were this year's runner-up in the Big Brother Awards for
         "Most Invasive Company"? This honour was bestowed thanks to
         their habit of storing data on almost everyone in the
         country, and a curious phrase in their privacy policy that
         states "While i-CD Publishing is committed to your privacy,
         we cannot guarantee that your private communications and
         other personally identifiable information will never be
         disclosed in ways not described by this policy". And you
         know, we can't help feeling that composing a database of
         10,000 known "subversives" wouldn't be worth something to
         *someone* around here...

</span><span class="item">         And even if MI6 aren't entrapping, those unsurprisingly
         competitive mites in the cut-throat world of comping (with
         which we are currently obsessed) are getting damn close with
         it. Hark to DOTCOMPER.CO.UK's bitchy attack this week on
         COMPINGQUEEN - both hawking commercial competition
         newsletters - in the uk.rec.competitions newsgroups. Dot
         accused Queen of stealing comps, and to prove it, secreted
         false "ringer" compos within their newsletter. Queen,
         naturally, went on to post the fake competitions as teasers
         for her 40UKP a year newsletter.Only slightly more
         puzzling than why such seasoned quiz buffs had spotted the
         fake ones ("Fair Play Cruises: First letters of answers
         spell JUDAS"), was why either company thought the
         uk.rec.competitions regulars would give a blank - given that
         so many comps were nicked from the froups. A few even
         referred to "the darker side of comping". Leaving both
         companies struggling to complete this common phrase or
         saying: Information seeks to be _____?

</span><span class="item">         But there's one place we can start tackling all this
         criminality - with those pesky kids! Based on the
         rigorous screening process that is the National Cycling
         Proficiency Exam, left- leaning thinktank THE INSTITUTE FOR
         PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH have proposed a "surfing proficiency
         test", where kids would airily prove that they know how to
         avoid porn before being allowed to browse by themselves - a
         scheme currently backed by Internet Magazine and old-school
         Pipex dude Bill Thompson (perhaps under the impression that
         it will include a written exam on Apache configs and obscure
         RFCs). On behalf of smartarse-kids-who-know-more-than-their
         -teachers everywhere, NTK wholeheartedly supports this
         alternative-to-censorship initiative, and has several
         suggestions for the test already: Did you "look both ways"
         to make sure no adults were around before searching for "XXX
         passwords"? Or, more pertinently, do you know not to use the
         search term "amateur" (as in "dramatics" or "astronomy") on
         altavista.co.uk, as this automatically starts feeding you
         banner ads for sex sites?

</span><span class="item">         FIRST TUESDAY LONDON, evidently still going strong, mailed its
         UK subscribers this week with an invitation to the "The Future
         of TV", followed by 60 lines of uuencoded text - their "most
         cryptic announcement to date", quipped one NTK reader. Those
         who did eventually decipher the message learned that the
         future of TV seems to be boring old broadband convergence
         (again), extensively discussed by the gang at a secret central
         London location on Tue 2001-02-06 (UKP10, you probably need to
         be "invited" or something, but somehow we doubt they'll be
         turning people away). Of course, that just happens to be the
         same night as the London leg of the ITC's 2001 FARADAY
         LECTURE, rumoured by boy-inventor (and Britain's best Yahoo
         Serious impersonator) Matt "Blackbelt" Jones to feature "Dr
         Johnny and his holographic TV" (6pm, Tue 2001-02-06, Wed 2001-
         02-07, Sadlers Wells, London). Not one to be left out, PROF
         KEVIN WARWICK continues his tireless efforts to warn of the
         imminent meccano apocalypse by asking "What is Intelligence?"
         at the Old Town Hall, Reading (Tue 2001-02-06, UKP5) - a

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; humourless diarist Adrian Mole goes through his second
         regeneration in THE CAPPUCCINO YEARS (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1) -
         hopefully C4 will compete with a follow-up series, set 18
         years later, of "Teenage Health Freak"... Tom Cruise and the
         Blade Runner unicorn frolic through Ridley Scott's extended
         Timotei ad LEGEND (7.40pm, Sat, BBC1)... and it appears to be
         "Sex Week" on Channel4 - for a change - kicking off with SEX:
         THE ANNABEL CHONG STORY (11.10pm, Sat, C4) - as we pointed out
         in NTK 2000-04-21, 251 guys no longer constitute "The World's
         Biggest Gang Bang" - then continuing with KAMA SUTRA: A TALE
         OF LOVE (10pm, Sun, C4), WHEN HARRY MET SALLY (10pm, Mon, C4),
         BETTER SEX (10pm, Tue, C4), PRIVATE PARTS: THE CLITORIS
         UNCOVERED (11.05pm, Tue, C4), gender-reassignment gameshow BOY
         MEETS GIRL (9pm, Tue, C4), cross-dressing French film MA VIE
         EN ROSE (12.05am, Tue, C4), POSITION IMPOSSIBLE (9pm, Wed, C4)
         and a double SEX IN THE CITY (10pm, Wed, C4) - all rounded off
         with the powerfully erotic, probing, questing presence of THE
         MARK THOMAS PRODUCT (11.20pm, Wed, C4)... the best C5 can come
         up with is "Murder Week", featuring Renee Zellweger polygraph
         psycho-thriller LIAR (9pm, Sun, C5) - written and directed by
         the "Good Vs Evil" Pate Brothers, mafia yawn GOODFELLAS (10pm,
         Mon, C5), plus Rutger Hauer regular THE HITCHER (9pm, Thu,
         C5)... after extensively indulging the "Lost Civilisations"
         theorising of Graham Hancock, C4 seem to be being a bit more
         skeptical about the "Was God An Astronaut?" claims of THE REAL
         ERICH VON DANIKEN (9pm, Mon, C4)... a creeping bioengineered
         menace threatens to wipe out all life on earth, but that's
         enough about the "Killer Algae" HORIZON (9pm, Thu, BBC2), BBC1
         are also showing the glacially dull STAR TREK: FIRST CONTACT
         (8.05pm, Thu)... and, for all the other column inches it's
         generated, no-one has yet commented on the game-theoretic
         implications of "your partner has to watch the video if you
         do" in the hypnotically compelling TEMPTATION ISLAND (10pm,
         Thu; 10.30pm, Sun, Sky1)...

         contain mirrors, and vampires "cast no shadow" anyway?... the
         aptly-named Michael Winterbottom answers the largely unasked
         question "What would 'Vertical Limit' be like if it was remade
         as a period drama and written by Thomas Hardy?" in THE CLAIM
         (imdb: Sarah "Go" Polley, Wes "American Beauty" Bentley, Milla

         - it's also the stuff _they_ were peddling 3 months ago... and
         ADRIAN MOULDER accused us of giving an atypically "easy ride"
         to rubberburner-alike <a href="http://www.stimulus.com/members/msl/">http://www.stimulus.com/members/msl/</a> ,

         continuing the vaguely genital-related theme, the proprietor
         of a well-known industry quotes site followed up NTK 2001-01-
         19's "Linuxcare will go down for stock" gag by observing
         "Perhaps you (and the original author ) weren't aware of this
         tidbit? <a href="http://www.upside.com/Chris_Nolan/39ee17e60.html">http://www.upside.com/Chris_Nolan/39ee17e60.html</a> "...
         ANGUS KENNEDY, clearly with plenty of time on his hands after
         the apparent demise of "his" MEN'S QUEST magazine [NTK 2000-
         05-12], has continued to amuse himself with the Kabalarian
         name analyser - <a href="http://www.kabalarians.com/male/penis.htm">http://www.kabalarians.com/male/penis.htm</a> -
         from NTK 2000-08-18... and finally, KATY LINFIELD wrote in a
         few weeks ago to inquire: "Why do you always degrade your
         TV/movie reviews with puerile references to whatever glimpses
         of female nudity may be seen?", citing "We see [Tea Leoni's]
         mostly obscured body through the smoked shower glass door"
         from NTK 2000-12-22, among other examples. Our rapid response
         team attempted to rectify this imbalance by packing subsequent
         issues with references to male nudity - "a few times [Tom
         Hanks'] buttock was exposed" [2001-01-12], "Geoffrey Rush
         shows us his butt for an extended amount of time" [2001-01-19]
         - only to be then accused, by ROS TAYLOR, of having become a
         "[more] homoerotic slashdot" (if such a thing is possible).
         Both were reassured by our excuse that the quotes are aimed to
         contrast the oddly similar reviewing styles of "Concerned
         Parents" websites, like <a href="http://www.screenit.com">http://www.screenit.com</a> and
         <a href="http://www.capalert.com">http://www.capalert.com</a> , with the rather more secularly
         motivated Celebrity Nudity Database <a href="http://www.cndb.com">http://www.cndb.com</a> - and
         to highlight the potential for possible abuse: nudity-hungry
         teens surfing the (often more comprehensive) god-sites for
         "recommendations", or more liberal parents judging suitability
         from listings in the CNDB - who, for instance, did attempt to
         contextualise Requiem For A Dream's sighting of "Jennifer
         Connelly's bush" [NTK 2001-01-19]... nonetheless, the debate
         remains open, so do let us know if you want to see more of
         "Tom Hanks' buttock" and its ilk. Please note that this does
         not mean we want you to send us your own nudity-sightings,
         especially the guy who mailed in a detailed account of the
         "several full frontals", "fine young jutting breasts", and
         "long hair falling across groin" he'd managed to freeze-frame
         on his DVD of Disney's "The Little Mermaid"...
