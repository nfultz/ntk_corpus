</span><span class="item">         So CNN call us up and ask: "Could you demonstrate the magic
         marker trick for defeating copy protection on Celine Dion
         CDs?" And we say: "Sure, but you know it only circumvents
         *some* copy protection systems - Cactus Data Shield 100/200
         and KeyAudio, apparently?" CNN don't seem too worried about
         this, and turn up with an "Attack Of The Clones" soundtrack,
         with "Will not play on PC/Mac" on the front. And, true enough,
         it won't read at all in our HP8100 CD-Writer Plus. "Do the
         magic marker trick", they plead, as we search in vain for the
         distinctive multi-session-style outer track, all the while
         explaining the numerous different kinds of copy-protection in
         contemporary usage, and eventually concluding "Oh, let's just
         try it in the other CD drive". And lo and behold, it rips
         without a hiccup from the crappy old LiteOn LTN382 32X using
         Easy CD-DA Extractor 3. The CNN crew try to hide it, but you
         can see the disappointment on their faces. In some ways, we
         shrug, this is a less televisual, but more interesting, story
         - all you need to get round copy protection is a friend with
         moderately lame old hardware. Unless that's illegal under the
         DMCA nowadays as well.

</span><span class="item">         All we ask for in the criss-crossed world of cyberrights is
         the occasional MASSIVE FIST-FIGHT. The closest this week was
         on the US BROADCAST PROTECTION DISCUSSION GROUP's conference
         call. This is where the MPAA and friends were finishing off
         the pseudo "consensus" they need to dictate little
         copyright-cop-chips in every part of the American digital
         network. Pesky meddling journalists were banned from the
         call: just as well, because haxx0rs weren't. Gatecrashing
         phreakers spent much of the call jaunting around the phone
         bridge reminding the Hollywooderati just how 0wned they
         were. Owned by feelingless multinational combines, of
         course. Hollywood, we imagine, will now mandate magic
         telephone chips that recognise when people who aren't in
         suits are making calls, and stop them until their motives
         are better known.

         are capitulating like craven dogs over the permanent storage
         of ISP logs and such. Given a choice between a nice, juicy
         clause that says member countries won't retain data unless
         it's for national security, is a temporary measure, and 
         (best bit) "based on a specific law which is comprehensible
         to the general public" - or a pile of namby pamby Eurodrivel

         (from 11am, Sun 2002-06-09, The Camden Centre, etc etc - now
         featuring John "Meteor Storm" Hollis and Nigel "Chuckie Egg"
         Alderton). However, in our really quite exciting role as
         "media sponsor", we're also compelled to mention the annual
         UKUUG LINUX DEVELOPERS' CONFERENCE (from 2002-07-04, Bristol,
         from UKP40+VAT if you book before Fri 2002-05-31, student
         concessions available), coincidentally the same day as the
         closing date for this year's NET-MEDIA ONLINE JOURNALISM
         AWARDS, which we accepted so graciously last year. Meanwhile,
         continuing this summer season of digital arty get-togethers,
         there's PLUG AND PLAY (from 6pm, Sunday 2002-05-26, Public
         Life, London E1, free we assume), the art/music event where
         you PLUG in whatever electronic kit you've brought, then use
         it to PLAY some music or videos. Public Life is of course the
         converted public toilet just opposite Spitalfields Market -
         and the only limit which the organisers wish to place upon
         your boundless creativity appears to be "no fucking bongos".

</span><span class="item">         Use Outlook Express? Yes? No? Whatever. You still badly need
         to know about OE-QUOTEFIX, the tiny utility by Dominik Jain
         that saves the world from Outlook's braindead quoting.
         Quotefix sits in the System Tray and silently waits for you
         to hit "reply" in Microsoft's mailer, then instantly
         reformats Outlook's illusion of what a reply mail looks like
         into something a bit saner. All the "&gt;" quoted bits are
         reformatted to fit on a 72 line, and a proper "Darth
         Tyrannus wrote:"-style accreditation added on the top line.
         Then, just for giggles, it colourises it so you can see who
         said what. Quotefix is utterly invisible, does nothing nasty
         with DLLs, exists completely independent from OE itself (you
         can run Outlook with or without it), and is free. If you
         must use Outlook Express, you can at last take part in long
         threads without fscking up the structure of the replies. And
         if you don't have OE, send this to your friends who do, as a
         handy way of starting to talk to them again.

         12-year-old boys live without adult supervision for a week,
