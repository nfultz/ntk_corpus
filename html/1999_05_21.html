</span><span class="item">         SORM-2, the Russian security service's plans to monitor the
         Internet, finally broke this week, with one Volgograd ISP
         manager, Nailj Murzahanov, deciding he'd had enough, and
         suing the spooks in court. SORM-2 is a Tap-You-Yourself
         policy by the cash-strapped KGB successors, the FSB: it
         requires ISPs to connect their local FSB office for free to
         their pipe, with agents able to sniff any and all packets
         (incoming and outgoing) from the comforts of their offices. 
         Oh, and the ISPs have to provide free support and training.
         Weirdly, in the year since the proposals were leaked, almost
         none of Russia's 350+ ISPs have protested. Nailj, who runs
         Bayard-Slavia Communications tried, and says he received
         death threats and - almost as bad for a Russian - an
         unscheduled audit from the dreaded tax police. Finally he
         was given just one month to be the first ISP to implement
         SORM. After that, the FSB cut off his feed. Now he's taking
         them to court for constitutional improprieties. Nailj's
         fellow sysadmins, though, remain quiet. But then, why
         make a fuss? As Andrei Sibrant, of Moscow's Glasnet said
         last year: "there is no reason for human rights groups who
         know nothing about the business to provoke a conflict".

                                        - and then they came for root

       - still masters of terror, as the X.25 references will confirm
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Wouldn't happen here, of course. So, in other news: European
         Justice ministers are meeting next week to discuss the all
         new ENFOPOL proposals. These are, you'll recall, a draft EU
         ruling that would require all Internet Service Providers to
         set up "high security interception interfaces inside their
         premises". Interfaces which would, if feasible, be linked
         remotely to government security agencies. But this time you
         don't get the death threats and the taxmen. But then again,
         we wouldn't know, because no ISP has complained yet.

             - bloody human rights groups trying to provoke conflicts
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         So, in a depressing week for civ libs, what can you do to
         cheer yourself up? Well, perhaps not peruse DUNCAN
         CAMPBELL's ECHELON report, with its perky descriptions of
         NSA taps at MAE-East and MAE-West, and happy-smiley
         descriptions of transatlantic mass interception technology.
         But we *do* like the suggestion that spun out of one of its
         discoveries. You knew, we assume, that the non-American
         versions of Lotus Notes encode 24 bits of their 64-bit
         encryption key with the NSA's key (thus making it possible
         for the NSA to crack European companies' private
         communications)? No? Oh. Sorry. Well, anyway: why not spend
         this weekend reverse-engineering it, to discover what the
         NSA public key actually is? That way, everyone can change it
         on their copies of Notes so that the NSA can't snoop. And we
         can all send them secure messages about exactly what we
         think about all of this unchecked, unbalanced, undiscussed,
         unpriced and, we'd suggest, unhinged surveillance apparatus.

         expenses. That MP3 piracy must be hitting them harder than

         Probably enough paranoia for us this week. Nonetheless at

</span><span class="item">         Many fans had nothing but praise for its technical
         achievement, but one critic in particular - NTK's Lloyd Wood
         - felt the need to voice his disappointment over the
         much-publicised "new chapter" in ASCIIMATION STAR WARS. "The
         animation is amazing," Wood concedes, "particularly when you
         read the FAQ and you realise that the author doesn't seem to
         have heard of Unix terminal support, curses etc and he's
         doing it all in a text editor and displaying chunks at a
         time. He's not generating deltas." Concerned by the
         creator's status as a lone auteur, Wood advises: "Somebody
         find a copy of the Twilight Zone VT100 animation, send it to
         him (and send me a copy), and explain how he can view it.
         Then explain rendering deltas using terminal support so he
         can do ASCII-MPEG, introduce non-flickery special effects,
         and call it 'Star Wars - the Special Edition'".

         beautiful, desirable person in school turns out to have a
         fantastically geeky side - but of course semi-amusing
         Matthew Lillard ultra-conformity advert SHE'S ALL THAT
         (imdb: teen / high-school / party / art-student / prom /
         popularity / bet / makeover) has to be just like everyone
         else, and does it the other way around. And it's directed by
         a former choreographer - natch... Mark "Marky Mark" Wahlberg
         continues his startling impersonation of that weird spanner
         kid from your primary school when partnered with Chow
         Yun-Fat in average police shoot-'em-up THE CORRUPTOR (imdb:
         mafia / gangster / gangs / new-york / police / triad /
         betrayal / boss / chase / chinatown / corrupt-cop)... while
         the biggest con in Stanley "Big Night" Tucci's old-fashioned
         farcical swindle-rama THE IMPOSTORS (imdb: 1930s /
         screwball) is making you think it'll be any good... so, our
         tip, salvaged from this week's wreckage: Sam Raimi swaps the
         Evil Dead for the greed-fuelled living, in deceptively
         uncomplicated Bill Paxton / Billy Bob Thornton wintry
         chiller A SIMPLE PLAN (imdb: murder / fratricide / money /

         librarian / tragedy / fbi / police / hospital / accountant /
         violence / twist-in-the-end / winter / based-on-novel /
         brothers ) - like "Shallow Grave", but good... or maybe
         Stephen King's most terrifying monster of all - Adolf
         Hitler! - in Bryan "The Usual Suspects" Singer's predictably
         harrowing David Schwimmer Nazi nutfest APT PUPIL (imdb:
         adaptation / psychological / teen / nazi / holocaust /
         evil). Can't imagine they'll be discussing its "Bloody

         plot at Columbine High movie night any time soon...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         "I THOUGHT I RECOGNISED YOUR FOUL TASTE"&gt;&gt; first, as
         promised, a round-up of fruit ices (and adulterants),
         kicking off with reader TIM BANNISTER's timely
         composition-analysis of WALLS' STAR WARS: EPISODE 1 "BATTLE
         DROID" FLAVOUR LOLLY (UKP0.35): "purports to be apple
         flavour... everyone I know thinks it tastes foul. It does
         smell a bit like a urinal block... the most refreshing thing
         in the freezer"... frozen north correspondent ALI DANIELS
         claims WALLS' SOLERO SHOTS are merely CALIPPO SHOTS by
         another name, and instead recommends TREATS' 5-ICE (price
         unknown), a stripey 5-flavour giant Fruit Pastille-style
         lolly which leaves you with "a useful 10" long piece of 1/4"
         dowling, which you can use to poke your respected colleagues
         in the side"... not much between the jelly blobs in NESTLE'S
         A BUG'S LIFE and WALLS' MR SPOT; our award for excessive
         innovation goes to NESTLE'S CRACKLER (about UKP0.45, Buzz
         Lightyear on pack) - an "orange and cherry" water ice
         containing what can best be described as a small,
         bullet-shaped payload of frozen popping candy. Don't eat
         it and let it melt of its own accord, and it collapses into
         a purple mass of seething, fizzing protoplasm... similarly,
         how much hot tea can you drink through the hollow chambers
         of otherwise standard chocolate bar CADBURY'S DAIRY MILK
         QUICK (UKP0.35) before it melts in on itself like a bad Dr
         Who villain?... in other confectionery news, it is of course
         "NESTLE'S special skill in combining chocolate, toffee and
         biscuit that makes ROLO COOKIES (UKP0.28) so delicious" -
         though much less biscuity than we expected, going from the
         precedent of the Cookies &amp; Caramel Rolo Eggs... over in
         pudding corner, the "Chocolate flavour custard" variant of
         BIRD'S SCOOPZ (UKP0.57) is perhaps the least violently
         disappointing, followed by the strawberry Angel Delight one,
         then the bizarre vanilla custard featuring apple-tainted
         biscuits... while the junior MULLER YOGZ 4-PACK are perhaps
         the most palatable of the "candy corner" yoghurts, in
         various sugar-heavy flavours (though no "YOG SOGOTH" version
         yet, Cthulhu fans!)... and finally, thanks to everyone who
         sent in the result of the consumer referendum at
         <a href="http://www.cocovote.com">http://www.cocovote.com</a> - if you hadn't guessed from the
         widespead offloading of old boxes of "Choco Krispies", a
         vast majority wanted them renamed COCO POPS - in accordance
         with natural law. Apparently "almost one million votes were
         cast", about the same number as in recent elections for the
         Welsh assembly...
