</span><span class="item">         Biggest excitement at COMPUTERS FREEDOM AND PRIVACY this
         year? Wired News' DECLAN MCCULLAGH getting nabbed by
         government agents after the Carnivore debate. Sadly for
         Dec's rep, the pair weren't after him for "knowing too
         much" - or even *writing* too much, for which they'd have a
         much better case. No, this was just another weirdly
         scattershot subpoena in the Treasury's ongoing case against JIM
         "Assassination Politics" BELL (also known as the one
         net.kook more libertarian than Declan). MCCULLAGH now joins
         JOHN "Cryptome" YOUNG in unwilling witnesses called in the
         case. Boy, you'd think that if you were forcing people to
         reveal supposed threats to the State, you'd choose people
         who were known to *stop* blabbing about them from time to time.

</span><span class="item">         Meanwhile - and we'd say in accordance with prophecy, but we
         never thought it'd pan out like this - after buying up a big
         bunch of The Big Breach (and obviously selling *all* of
         them, clearly, no problems there), noted secrecy/privacy
         busters 192.COM have apparently liberated their own content,
         and are now offering a free bookz version of the Tomlinson
         autobio. Of course, now it's readily available and you don't
         have to go through the fun of self-righteously mirroring it,
         the book itself is kinda boring, but you can get it in Word
         format, presumably with KGB Macro virus and MAC number of
         Tomlinson's desktop PC included. Think we'll wait for the
         seven-line Perl precis.

</span><span class="item">         Sure, we've all wondered about the accountability of charities
         who receive large sums of public money from time to time - but
         few of us have had as much opportunity to do something about
         it as WIPO who, next week, we believe are due to decide the
         fate of leonard-cheshire.com, "a work of interventionist art"
         constructed by disabled people - who happen to occasionally
         criticise UK charity THE LEONARD CHESHIRE FOUNDATION (who,
         naturally, own the non-profit leonard-cheshire.org). It's
         impressive to see just how much ill-will this apparently
         well-meaning care-provider has generated (over its alleged
         institutionalisation of disabled people and priorities in
         distribution of funding); leonard-cheshire.com's defence in
         the domain dispute argues that it clearly identifies itself as
         an "anti-Leonard Cheshire Foundation website", and should
         therefore not be mistaken for the "real thing" - unless of
         course the "real" site also includes such playfully satirical
         content as "What can I do if I do not like disabled people
         and want to see them banged up in institutions away from the
         community and only let out in controlled groups with lots of
         'carers' to protect the public from their hideous presence?"

</span><span class="item">         We've been a bit slack over this year's COMPUTER SECURITY
         COLLOQUIA at the LSE (Wed 2001-03-14: "Future Technology/
         Future Information Security", with David Lacey of the Post
         Office). After that, there's always the looming threat of the
         complex emotions elicited by COMIC RELIEF - sure, you'd like
         to help, but there's always the lingering doubt that you may,
         in some small way, be unwittingly prolonging the careers of
         Lenny Henry or Richard Curtis. One initiative we feel we can
         give our typically half-hearted support to is the DUBBLE BAR
         (RRP around 35p) - "Milk Chocolate With Caramelised Crisp
         Rice", produced in keeping with "Fairtrade" principles and
         perhaps uncharitably described by NTK readers as "rather too
         sweet for me - each rice grain seems like it's been injected
         with sugar" (Tim Aidley) and "just a really thick version of
         Dairy Crunch with not very good chocolate" (Mike Gray). We,
         however, kind of liked it - though it does pale in comparison
         with the shockingly tasty Organic range launched this week by
         NTK e-commerce affiliates CYBERCANDY, our personal favourites
         being the bars with big chunks of apple and orange and ginger
         and stuff in.

</span><span class="item">         You know the problem. You've upped your BogoMips, padded out
         your address space with cheapo SDRAM, slotted a couple of
         forty giggers in your bays: your desktop is at eleven.
         Except for one thing. Your average load: a pathetic 0.01.
         That needs to be rounded up. But with such conspicuous
         consumption tendencies, you're just not the type to donate
         them to some fly-by-night key-cracking, ET-searching,
         AIDS-curing distributed "effort". No, you need MGM. Written
         by Ogg Vorbis' very own Xiphophorus, MGM (which stands for
         Moaning Goat Meter, you crazy WIPO people) is a load meter
         with a catch: the principal load is itself. It's written in
         Perl-TK. It thrashes itself silly measuring system params
         about once every other instruction. It take plug-in. It show
         spinning fish. It look real pretty. It take up more RAM than
         Emacs. No, really.

         (9.05pm, Sat, BBC2) - which, by the way, had better not
         overlook the publication of the "Watchmen" graphic novel and
         the release of "Beat Dis" by Bomb The Bass - events which, as
         far as we're concerned, effectively marked the start of the
         modern era... while this week's autistic spectrum appearances
         include idiot-savant exaggeration docu FRAGMENTS OF GENIUS
         (7.40pm, Sun, BBC1), a fictionalised version of the same thing
         in RAIN MAN (10.55pm, Sun, BBC1), plus a pair of high-

</span><span class="geekmedia">         NASTY, BRITISH AND SHIRT(S)&gt;&gt; feverish speculation over the
         contents of NTK's "Spring Collection" can now be (temporarily)
         stilled, as we reveal that our first new T-shirt design -
         unveiled today at <a href="http://www.ntkmart.com/">http://www.ntkmart.com/</a> - is something of a
         timeless "retro classic": a screenshot of BBC Micro "Elite"
         with the letters "NTK" pasted into it! Respect is due to
         shadowy creators "Violence Through Kittens" for volunteering
         to donate their royalties to NTK's adopted PC-recyclers the
         Redundant Technology Initiative (and for keeping the original
         GIF down to less than 4K in size); kudos also to Elite authors
         Ian Bell and David Braben, who we did ask to check that they
         didn't mind, and they said "fine"... which makes this month's
         Runner-Up that "Bruce" guy again - who, attendees at our
         Christmas Party may recall, recklessly agreed to gamble his
         royalties from the "I got UKP80million in venture capital"
         design on a print run of one of his other ones - specifically
         the deviously renaissance-man slogan "iMachiavellian: Think
         dissident", printed in a curiously familiar-looking font in
         delicate light blue on a gorgeous "graphite" dark grey shirt.
         And we've even managed to get some of our old favourites
         available in both sizes - Medium *and* XL - next we might even
         consider shipping to the US, if they really beg for it...
         still, if you think you can do better, the good news is we're
         planning at least one new design every month now until we get
         bored - plus we're setting up some sort of gallery of entries
         that we're still "not sure about", which currently includes
         HANDANOVA's surreal <a href="http://www.geekparty.net/tshirt.html">http://www.geekparty.net/tshirt.html</a> ,
         JEREMY ARDLEY's RIP-aware <a href="http://www.ardley.org/shadowsml.jpg">http://www.ardley.org/shadowsml.jpg</a>
         (based on <a href="http://www.nara.gov/exhall/powers/shadow.jpg">http://www.nara.gov/exhall/powers/shadow.jpg</a> ), and
         NICK SZCZEPANIK's text-only back-print "WARNING: I SLOW DOWN
         FOR SHOE SHOPS", to be printed in "in women's sizes only",
         and allegedly inspired by "his girlfriend". Though we're
         definitely calling a moratorium on those fucking Einsteins
         who've proposed some sort of "All Your Base Are Belong To Us"
         variant - SIMON BATISTONI is partly forgiven for "NTK: They
         Set Us Up The Bomb - Now We Have Set Them Up It Back" - but,
         attention reader HARRY HARRIS: "All Your Memes Are Belong To
         Us"? You're going to have to try harder than that...
