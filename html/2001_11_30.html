</span><span class="item">         So what, exactly, went on with the latest "biggest ever"
         kiddy porn crackdown? Most of the media tut-tutted about the
         10,000 "IPs" who downloaded porn, the cleverness of the
         National Crime Squad at detecting them, and the tragedy that
         only 129 of them were traced. And thank God, of course, for
         public-spirited Demon who agreed to let the police "image"
         its news server, and handed over the IP addresses of
         everyone accessing over 1500 newsgroups. Well, except that
         Demon now deny this ever occurred, understandable given that
         it'd be illegal under the DPA, and say that the police only
         had the same access as anyone else to USENET postings, and
         thus could only trace posters not readers. Normally we'd put
         this down to woeful tech reporting: in this case though,
         journalists were exercising the *other* skill they have -
         copying press releases verbatim. The National Crime Squad
         and its reps actively boasted that servers were imaged, and
         the source of that "10,000 reader's IPs" statistic is from
         the official statement on the matter. So what happened? Why
         did the NCS - including, at some points, the Det. Super. in
         charge of the investigation, insist on a story that Demon
         now deny? Ignorance of their own methods? A misguided
         attempt by Thus and NCS pointy-hairs to create a
         high-publicity paedophile investigative coup, when all that
         went on was a smart copper doing what anyone with a Demon
         account and a Perl script could pull off in a week? Or did
         Demon really pass on mass subscriber information to the NCS,
         assuming at the time that the NCS wouldn't be so dumb as to
         blab about how Thus'd happily hand over their subscribers'
         mass traffic data? Guess we'll never know. Unless, of
         course, you're a Demon subscriber and want to put in a
         complaint to the Information Commissioner to find out what
         *really* went on. Hint, hint.

</span><span class="item">         Mr Gates is due in the UK this week, patting Blair's head,
         helping him find that Start button again, and charitably
         offering a few hits of the XP subscription-only crack-pipe.
         God help Bill, though, if gets collared by other more techy
         European politicians. Windows XP just trashed the hard drive
         of FRANCESCO COSSIGA, the 73-year ex-Presidente of Italy -
         and he's out for vendetta. As semi-retired politicians who
         do their own OS installs go, Cossiga is a tech support case
         from hell: professor of Law, ex-investigating magistrate,
         and since quitting the Presidency, a man with plenty of time
         and who no longer gives a shit. This is a man who idly
         tarried over details of St Thomas More's wishful dreams of a
         menage a trois - at a Vatican press conference. He says
         he's itching to take Microsoft to court. "In the tribunal,
         we will be able to enjoy ourselves. I'm almost hoping they
         won't be able to fix it!", he cackles. Worst of all for
         anyone hoping for a quick fight: he's a radio ham. Capos
         with callsigns: bad combination.

         in a bar, NTK's set of "Acoustic Cover Versions of Synth Pop
         Classics" has now joined the lineup at CHRISTMAS DORKBOT
         LONDON (from 7pm, Wed 2001-12-05, The Boxing Club/ Limehouse
         Town Hall, London E14, free). But we won't be on till later
         (around 9?) as we've also agreed to speak at IS SPIN DYING? IS
         THE INTERNET TO BLAME?, a "round table hosted by Voxpolitics
         and the Social Market Foundation" (from 6pm, Wed 2001-12-05,
         Warwick Room, The Social Market Foundation, Westminster,
         London). We'll be violently disagreeing with the motion that
         "Networked politics means people are getting smarter, more
         organised, more likely to kick something" and, by doing so,
         inadvertently helping them to prove their point.

         dressing up in ridiculous costumes to engage in a bit of
         "fantasy role-playing" to enliven their otherwise pointless,
         friendless lives. But that's enough about this year's EROTICA
         2001 exhibition (from today, London Olympia, around UKP17) -
         it's that time of year once again for some healthy tabletop
         action over at DRAGONMEET 2001 (from 10am, Sat 2001-12-01,
         UKP6, Kensington Town Hall, London - former location of World
         Of Amiga '99). Among the treats promised by organiser James
         Wallis are: Guest of honour John "Dork Tower" Kovalic (again),
         auctioning the only set of Pokethulhu miniatures in the
         country. The first UK sighting of the games biz's longest-
         running piece of vapourware, the "Realms of Sorcery" hardback,
         first described as "coming soon" in November 1986. Twice the
         number of traders as last year. And a bar. And hot food. And
         "complaining about the lack of clerics in the D&amp;D movie until
         we're pasty in the face". That's *pastier*, surely...

         "100 million yen ($830,000) each" we (and MIT) reported last
         week. He remained uncharacteristically silent, however, on the
         matter of the "fsck /gnu/linux" t-shirt [also last week]
         which, under the circumstances, we're tempted to take as some
         sort of blessing... on the same story, "Is that journalism?",
         asked original gadfly DAVE WINER, though presumably he'll be

         it, but I don't hate it", asserted THE INQUIRER's Andrew
         Thomas [NTK 2001-10-26; 2001-11-23], before going for the
         killer punchline: "Now, Linux - that I hate"... thanks to

         the <a href="http://www.paintthemoon.org/">http://www.paintthemoon.org/</a> project [NTK 2001-10-26] -
         still didn't work though, did it?... BARRY DE LA ROSA
         advocated the "beta of ICEOWS, the next generation version of
         ARJFolder" [NTK 2001-11-09], recommending its "whole bunch
         more formats (including Colin McRae 2!)" and "full folder
         extraction as well". "But it's still French", he concedes...
         and, finally, JOE WHITELEY, seemingly unaware of the net's
         time-honoured "slash" tradition, felt we could be entrusted
         with the red-hot info that "There's an online community thing
         dedicated to writing new chapters for, say, Buffy, or Xena, in
         which they have sex". But "Buffy isn't the most popular", Joe
         confides - that honour goes to "Sabrina the Teenage Witch".
         "One of those things, I guess", he shrugs. "Maybe the stories
         feature the two aunts as well, that'd give it an edge"...
