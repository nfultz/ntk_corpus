</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         In these days of plunging markets, it's hard to pinpoint
         just one story that illustrates our own holding position:
         that Net stocks are a device to transfer money from the
         innocent to the guilty. But the tale of QXL's NASDAQ price
         in the last week will do. Start from last Thursday, when SG Cowen
         analyst Tom Bock announced that QXL was a "strong buy", and
         predicted its eventual rise to a $333 stock value. Why?
         Because - well, heck, they're the European Ebay, right, and
         Europe's bigger than the US - so any minute now they'll get
         an Ebay-like valuation. That call was based on some
         interesting assumptions - that EBay hasn't made in-roads
         into Europe, and that there are no other European
         auctioneers of note. It took us ten minutes to spot another
         five or so major auction sites in Germany (one of QXL's
         longest established turfs) just by browsing yahoo.de. And
         running a "links" count on altavista shows around 280 pages
         pointing to qxl.de - compared to 1800 for ebay.de and 1700
         for ricardo.de, another German auctioneer. Bock's timing was
         particularly cute, given that the "strong buy"
         recommendation came on the same day as a three-way split,
         which has a habit of confusing casual investors into
         thinking that the stock price is unnaturally low. After a
         brief spike to around $110, the stock slumped to close to
         $20 - a ride in which only the little guys got seriously
         hurt. And we're sure it was pure coincidence that the hype
         was days before the end of the six-month lock-in
         of shares by the institutional investors...

</span><span class="item">         Crazy give-away time in the wonderful world of VIRGIN's
         Internet experiment. In the US, the company offered this
         week to give away 10,000 WebTVish things in return for
         audience data (you'll remember this ploy from about a year
         ago, when everyone else tried it). In the UK, VIRGIN NET
         gave away their entire design staff to ZEFER, as head
         designer Rik Gadsby and most of his colleagues stepped
         outside for a breath of fresh air... and never... came...
         back. But hold: surely they were all set to become as rich
         as Rich in the real-soon-now Virgin Net IPO?

</span><span class="item">         And so to Infosec 2000, where the exhibitors handed out
         their scaremongery fliers, and tried to shut up the DNS Con
         guys, who found exploits in at least sixteen exhibitor
         websites. K3yn0te Sp33k0r RLoxley seemed very excited by
         the much-rumoured "gathering of the ten", in which a bunch of
         "the planet's greatest hackers" will combine to form a
         company to provide commercial security services
         - or battle Galactus, we're not sure which. But his
         glee was no match for the enthusiasm of the London 2600
         regulars. Approached by a BBC producer keen to do yet
         another hacking documentary, they happily regaled her with
         details of the dark, illegal - and strangely captivating -
         lives they led. The producer stood by, rapt with fascination
         at their elititude. As did the Network Manager of a major
         British Police force, who was standing about ten yards away.
         Looks like the show's already on the road, kids!

         Sunday, one of NTK's oldest pals and regular Tracking
         contributor, Yoz Grahame, was admitted into the Royal Free
         hospital intensive care, after a fit. He was diagnosed as
         suffering pressure on the brain, and remained unconscious
         until Thursday. The doctors are still not sure what caused
         the problem (trust Yoz to discover an obscure, white-label
         import virus), but we're pleased to report that he's now
         awake, and seems to be rebooting just fine. Yoz, kid, next

         presumably not changed to tie in with the seemingly unrelated
         domains dotcomedy.co.uk or dotcomedy.com... plus: a tongue-in-

         none of whom, interestingly, are actually called "Kevin"...
         plus: hacking, biotech, set in 2012, - no chance *at all* of
         FUTURECAST (9pm, Thu, C4) being just more "Killer Net" cyber-

</span><span class="geekmedia">         DEAD TREE PUBLISHING&gt;&gt; three words: AMIGA FORMAT - FALCOOOOO!
         Future Publishing's long-running Amiga mag (arguably the
         "Off'al Playstation Magazine" of its day) has published its
         last, with long-standing editor Nick Veitch heading up new
         launch LINUX FORMAT (due Fri 2000-04-28) - all traces of the
         hilariously NT-served <a href="http://www.linuxanswers.co.uk/">http://www.linuxanswers.co.uk/</a> [see NTKs
         passim] having been mysteriously erased... this being Future,
         no sooner is one struck down than three more spring up in its
         place, the other two being the UK edition of BUSINESS 2.0
         (content 60% sourced from over here, with "the rest from the
         US" - ex-Wired UK staffers, get your CVs in now!)... plus, out
         now, the wildly underpriced MP3 MAGAZINE - only UKP4.99 for
         *98* glossy pages (not quite as many legitimate applications
         as they thought?) Great site <a href="http://www.mp3magazine.co.uk/">http://www.mp3magazine.co.uk/</a>
         too!... on to happier news, with first-time caller KEVIN CECIL
         guest-hosting this month's Covermount Corner, and recommending
         the "very good free CD of Easy Listening Lounge music" on the
         front of LATER, including a "sitar version of 'I Can See For
         Miles'" - either the entire CD, or this track alone, is "well
         worth the UKP3 cover price" - Kevin fails to specify. Plus,
         "The CD is designed to look like a CD that you have bought
         rather than a 'shit magazine one' which seems a major advance
         in free CDdom. The magazine itself is rather poor"... but, for
         once, atrocity of the month goes to EMAP ACTIVE, for their
         staggeringly daft Edge-alike "PS This Publication Is Not
         Authorised Or Approved By Sony. PS2 And Playstation2 Are
         Trademarks Of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc" (UKP3.99) - a
         largely unnecessary disclaimer given that the content is so
         ridiculously pro-PS2 even Sony would be embarrassed to run it.
         Amid the Designers Rupublic [(c) Edge Magazine, May 1999]
         knock-off graphics, shamefully blocky screengrabs, and sub-
         Off'al Dreamcast "fashion shoots", there's even the typically
         on-the-ball opinions of "style journalists" from The Face and
         The Big Issue - the latter disappointingly not providing, in
         counterbalance to all the tedious "Trojan Horse" propaganda
         elsewhere, an analysis of exactly how the Playstation 2 will
         revolutionise digital entertainment possibilities available to
         homeless people...
