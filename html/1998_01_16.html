         Net's secondary search engine" this week, by offering every
         schoolchild in the UK a free e-mail account, supported by
         "suitable" advertising. Lots of fun questions instantly
         arise: given that Web e-mail is about as insecure as you
         can get, which teen hacker will be the first to write a
         password grabber that lets them read the rest of the
         school's mail - including the teachers? And who exactly are
         "suitable" advertisers for kids? Crayola? Mattel? And given

</span><span class="item">         Already a strong candidate for Antinews of the Year,
         WEBMEDIA's collapse - what's the cliche we're looking for
         here? - sent shockwaves through the UK Web design
         community. As if there wasn't enough Shockwave there as it
         is. Damage was concentrated near the epicentre, which might
         explain the tsunami of invective directed at investors
         Megalomedia on Webmedia's ex-site over the weekend. Sources
         at Webmedia indicated that the accusations contained in the
         hacked site were wildly inaccurate, but sources went a bit
         quiet about why, in that case, Megalomedia stomped so
         heavily on any site that dared to copy the accusations ...
         for reporting purposes, naturally. In the meantime, ex-
         Webmedia partner Ivan Pope is sniggering his way to a
         couple of big announcements in the near future. Can anti-
         Pope Steve Bowbrick fight back? Now that he's got a
         comfortable consultancy, does he even care?

</span><span class="item">         When DENNIS announced the "suspension" of Net 'n' Chicks
         'n' Games 'n' Lager magazine ESCAPE this week, the board
         said they felt that "the market was not yet ready". What
         they didn't reveal was that the market in question was
         eponymous company owner Felix Dennis. Best known for his
         involvement in the Oz magazine trial, when he was charged
         with corrupting youth, and the BLENDER CD-ROM magazine
         trial, when he was charged with corrupting AUTOEXEC.BATs,
         Felix was holidaying in Mustique when he received the
         latest issue of the mag. Unfortunately for everyone, it was
         raining, and Felix actually read it. One phone-call
         later, and it was all over for the plucky - if occasionally
         absentee - team. Concerned Dennis employees are now
         wondering where the Felix finger of death will touch next.
         Hint: he was last seen flicking through a mag whose design,
         it is said, he feels to be "art wank shit".

</span><span class="item">         Microsoft's new "charm offensive" got off to a bad start
         this week. As reported by the frankly great <a href="http://www.tbtf.com">www.tbtf.com</a>,
         Microsoft's Chief of Operations Robert Herbold was asked in
         one of their "friendly" interviews how small firms could
         compete with his company. Herbold said they had three
         options: fight a losing battle, sell out to Microsoft, or
         they could "not go into business to begin with because,
         hey, if you're a betting person, you know which way it's
         going to go." Elsewhere, Microsoft continued to discover
         that you can't bullshit a bullshitter - especially such a
         distinguished veteran as the US government. In court,
         Microsoft handwaved through the files on the Internet
         Explorer CD-ROM, and explained how Windows 95 just couldn't
         work without them. Readers who've never installed Explorer
         are excused wondering how they ever managed without;
         readers who have installed Explorer should now understand
         that they are never *ever* going to get rid of it. Judge
         Jackson looked suitably underwhelmed. Where do you want to
         go today, Microsoft, he seemed to hiss - Sing Sing?

</span><span class="item">         We'd have pursued our usual Tracking search for the best
         new code and sites this week, but our bandwidth was wiped
         out by helpful replies to our claim to have "lost track of"
         net.pundit Wavey Davey W*****r.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         It was Gary Taylor who first pointed us in the direction of
         PC PRO magazine, where Davey apparently runs a regular
         column under the byline "Dave Winder - author, freelance
         journalist, broadcaster and consultant specialising in the
         Internet and computer communications". Paul Agius reports
         that one of Wavey's recent columns was "about a web page
         called Davey Winder Haters." (That'll be us as well then -
         in fact, it badly needs updating, but it's tough keeping up
         with all the mail...) According to Paul, "He did not seem
         to be amused." Hopefully, Davey offers a more cheery aspect
         to his readers in top glamour title FIESTA, where Andy Stox
         resolutely claimed not to have spotted another of his Net
         columns.
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         We also received an e-mail about "a friend of a friend" who
         worked with Wavey Davey on our previously featured video
         GAMES ON THE .NET (still reduced to UKP1.99 at Virgin
         Megastores). This FOAF claimed that Wavey Davey wore a
         wooden leg throughout the filming. Well, that seems as good
         a point as any to close the correspondence. We request that
         any more sightings of Davey Winder - or any part thereof -
         be sent to Davey directly at <a href="mailto:waveydavey@dial.pipex.com">waveydavey@dial.pipex.com</a>,
         where we understand he is always glad to receive your mail.

         (and the public) hated it, but action movies got way more
