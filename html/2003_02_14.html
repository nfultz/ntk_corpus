</span><span class="item">         In the eve of conflict, right before we're all drafted to
         write shoot-'em-ups for our cool new military empire, all is
         quiet. Too quiet, we say. Where are the voices we've come 
         to depend on to pierce through the silence with their handy
         suggestions of how this war should *really* be run? More
         precisely: just where are JON KATZ and ERIC RAYMOND when
         their country needs them? Rent-a-blather JonKatz appears to
         have vanished from Slashdot some time last July (when he
         uttered, pointedly, that even H.L. Mencken "wouldn't be able
         to find work these days"). And while black-belt warlord ESR
         is reputedly working on his Art of Unix book, his old site
         at tuxedo.org has been transformed, in abstentia, into a
         disrespectful flickbook of redirects to peacenik backsliders
         like the Free Software Foundation and <a href="http://www.ethics.org">www.ethics.org</a>. Could
         it be too much to hope that ESR and Jon Katz might have been
         the first casualties of war? Apparently so. From an
         undisclosed location, an all-too-lively Raymond reports that
         these Apache Weapons Of Mass Redirection are not his work,
         are undetectable from his home machine, and therefore, North
         Korean-fashion, DO NOT EXIST. Meanwhile, the reclusive JK
         has, it seems, abandoned geek politics and indeed humanity,
         having now tracked down a silent minority who don't talk
         back when he's trying to speak for them. Yes, Anonymous
         Cowards the world over will be relieved to know that JK now
         writes exclusively about dogs. And so those words of
         prophecy come home to haunt us all: "Human sacrifice, dogs
         - and Katz - living together, mass hysteria!"

</span><span class="item">         Of course, marching round London is all very well, but what if 
         you really want to hit the military-industrial-entertainment 
         complex where it hurts? One ingenious - yet anonymous - NTK 
         reader may have an answer, in the form of a breathtakingly 
         realistic video cover he's created, pioneeringly depicting US 
         President George W Bush as a fish-out-of-water idiot who just 
         happens to find himself running the world's least accountable
         superpower. What's more, the 1614k jpg is exactly the right size 
         for responsibly-minded individuals to print it out in glossy 
         inkjet colour, slide it into an empty DVD sleeve, and leave it 
         in a prominent position in their local video library/ rental 
         superstore, where, our correspondent hopes, "it should confuse 
         and delight in equal measure". The section you leave it in - 
         Comedy? Action? True Crime? - is entirely up to you.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Another sign we're hitting the end game - or the end of one
         game, at least. DAVID BRABEN finally dropped the other shoe,
         and obliged Christian Pinder to withdraw his meticulous
         re-engineering of Elite, The New Kind - and all derivatives
         (PocketPC, SGI, Linux, Windows, Palm, whatever) thereof. 
         Naturally, 1980s videogame re-enactment societies the
         world over were bereft. But amongst open brawling of the
         warez hawks and copyright-appeasers of alt.fan.elite, only
         Pinder emerges as a ruefully clear voice of sanity. Yes, he
         did devote n+1 months of his life to reverse-engineering
         Elite and implementing it in C. Yes, it is a shame that
         Braben has now required him to withdraw TNK from
         circulation. But no, the brave young coder doesn't have
         much of a legal leg to stand on, so he's not bitter.
         Besides, he's now working on a legacy-unencumbered Elite
         sequel with Ian Bell, fittingly titled "Darkness Falls".
         It's due out in March 2003 - if you can wait that long.

         and hopefully some NTK t-shirts here and there. But if you (or

         not follow it up with a transatlantic trip to 2003's "premier

</span><span class="item">         Now that the Tivo UK is dead, what are you going to do with
         all that free time? Well, how about wasting it to build your
         own PVR out of a sub-100UKP video capture card, a 500Mhz
         Linux box and one of many open source digital recorder
         projects filling the (carefully orchestrated) timetables of
         idealistic young TV obsessives these days? Neither MYTHTV
         nor FREEVO are ready for rolling out onto your grandparents'
         settop boxen (unless your nan knows how to install MySql, or
         hand-edit dodgy XML and Python config files). Both suffer
         slightly from that post-Enlightenment open source
         development strategy of coding until you hit a cool enough
         screenshot, then moving on. But when you can get them to
         work, they *do* work. And there is something enticing about
         seeing live TV pause and rewind on your root window; seeing
         the week's TV guide construct itself from thin air, Ananova,
         and perl scripts; watching on-the-fly anti-aliased text fade
         majestically over your digitally recorded programmes; and
         controlling it all using your remote and serial-port IR
         adaptor. TV just looks better when you're processing it at 
         home.

         BONERS: CORRECTIONS, CLARIFICATIONS, AND "INCORRECTLY REGARDED 
</span><span class="geekmedia">         AS GOOFS"&gt;&gt; first up, apologies to all of you who were so 
         distressed by our faltering attempts at an FAQ earlier this 
         year. "When I was a lad, we didn't have any pansy crib-sheets 
         to NTK, no York Notes - we had to read the damn thing, and 
         decipher it ourselves", reminisced TOM ANDERSON; "This was the 
         most boring NTK ever. Not knowing what the fuck you're on 
         about is half (I lie: ALL) the fun!", agreed KARL DALLAS. And 
         "Stop with your sentimental self-aggrandizing", commanded 
         ADRIAN WARD, with just the lone voice of PAUL BLEZARD piping 
         up "PS: Grateful for all the useful explanations in this 
         week's edition". Once again, apologies (and especially to you, 
         Paul) - it won't happen again... further controversy raged as 
         JOSH ROULSTON pleaded "Stop it with the Google mis-spellings - 
         they're rubbish", though ALEC BOWMAN describes them as "the 
         best fun [he's] had for ages". The deciding vote - for now - 
         goes to FIPR's crypto guru (and co-author of Locoscript for 
         the Amstrad PCW) RICHARD CLAYTON, who gave the feature his 
         critical imprimatur with the statistical analysis that 
         <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cyrptographic">http://www.google.com/search?q=cyrptographic</a> is, at the moment, 
         by far the most popular misspelling of the word. Richard 
         went on to observe that, in a subtle variation on the "missing 
         millions" gag, the BBC seem to have added an extra 0 to the 
         number of CDs needed by AOL for data retention requirements 
         <a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-01-31">http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?b=02003-01-31</a> , as you can see by 
         searching <a href="http://www.apig.org.uk/ispa_oral_evidence.htm">http://www.apig.org.uk/ispa_oral_evidence.htm</a> for 
         "36"... virtually all our other errors so far this year seem 
         largely due to NTK's oh-so-parochial Britishness: DAVID THIEL 
         was the first of many to claim that Americans, with their 
         endearing literalism, "routinely refer" to stick insects as 
         "walking sticks": <a href="http://www.ntk.net/2003/01/17/dohwalk.gif">http://www.ntk.net/2003/01/17/dohwalk.gif</a> ; 
         KATE MCDONNELL revealed "many Euro languages" use "biological" 
         the same way we use "organic", hence our misunderstanding 
         over: <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hotelannelies/ha2e.html">http://www.geocities.com/hotelannelies/ha2e.html</a> - see 
         also <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22biological+cooking%22">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22biological+cooking%22</a> ; 
         SHARON DAVIDSON protested it was "Vancouver, Washington state" 
         in <a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/news_alert_011303_general.html">http://www.prisonplanet.com/news_alert_011303_general.html</a> 
         - not Vancouver in Canada; and - finally - "Can I be the first 
         to say that [NTK 2003-01-03] spelled Wehrmacht incorrectly?", 
         inquired WILLIAM WILES, before signing off with the intriguing 
         detail that he is "Chief sub-editor" of "Housing Today"...
