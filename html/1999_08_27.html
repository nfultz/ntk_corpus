</span><span class="item">         O'Reilly's OPEN SOURCE CONVENTION didn't end with a bombing,
         which was a surprise - with the leading lights in Perl,
         Python, Apache, and Sendmail all in the same hotel, sense
         trigger-fingers in the Redmond silos must have been
         twitching. Or else - every hacker's nightmare - they'd set
         upon each other. Extending the invitation to speak to the
         Emacs/GNU heartland to Bill "vi/Java" Joy didn't seem too
         politic, for starters. And didn't anyone notice the start of
         comp.lang.perl.misc's open season on Python programmers?
         Even kindly Larry Wall shot off a few snipes, and given his
         State Of The Onion theme ("chemicals") and the tear-gas
         quantities of real chopped onion he released, you could see
         it was only a short step to weedkiller and sugar. And adding
         nitro to the glycerin: who invited Dave Winer? Proprietary
         Dave set upon the free software like Carlos the Jackal at a
         World Trade Organisation shin-dig. Open source, he
         translated for Scriptiny News, was an "open sore", Brian
         Behlendorf and co. were "dictators", ESR "an asshole", Perl
         a "hacked-up language", and the "cheezy" Unix boxes in the
         network room couldn't even do cut and paste properly (until
         someone showed him how). Man, it was almost as if Tim
         O'Reilly hired him to distract everyone from each other's
         throats. Hey, wait a minute...

         peddle their hate-speech on the Net of Fear, we're still
         fascinated by crusading Sunday Times journalist, JONATHAN
         UNGOED-THOMAS and his mission to get the hang of
         fakemailing. He's almost cracked it now, we think, with
         "laura.jones@angelfire.com", who recently made contact with
         those anarchist desperadoes The Legal Defence and Monitoring
         Group. Ms Jones says she is "particularly violently opposed
         to animal testing and genetically modified food", and "is
         good with computers." Not quite good enough to go to the
         LDMG's homepage, though, where she would have learned they
         disbanded in October of last year. Double-plus, Ungoed - but

</span><span class="item">         With reports that an outbreak of syphilis in San Francisco
         was traced to users meeting via a AOL chatroom, it's not the
         most auspicious week for AOL to launch NETSCAPE ONLINE, a
         free ISP targetted at "single young men". Still, there's
         even weirder vibes emanating from other side of the Netscape
         alliance. Take the invite Silicon Valley residents received
         this week, advertising a special seminar by by Carol
         Montgomery-Adams, Vice President of Customer Loyalty at the
         Sun/Netscape Alliance. Intrigued? Then be sure to RSVP to
         the reply address: The Church Of Scientology, Palo Alto
         Mission. Now, we're not ones to slag off the Scientologists
         (for compelling legal reasons), but it'd be fair to say that
         the last thing anyone can teach them about is ensuring
         customer loyalty, no?

         that the boss' daughter can access the Web" (though, in 
         most places, that's a start). Admittedly, it's probably not

</span><span class="item">         Normally we don't feature software we haven't actually
         tried, but since TOTALLY MAD (Windows CD-ROM, US$70) is a
         7-disc archive of 564 complete back issues of Mad Magazine,
         we feel we *have* been incrementally testing this product,
         over the course of the last 46 years. "High-quality images
         of low-quality humor" are promised, letting you view pages
         with "startling (and disturbing) clarity".

</span><span class="item">         And, sounding like it should be a parody, but isn't: Ayn
         Rand meets Sim City is the theme of yet-to-be-completed
         ATLAS SHRUGGED INTERACTIVE - a bold attempt to adapt the
         famed libertarian tract into videogame form. The inventor's
         got the rights already; he just needs a few programmers,
         artists, actors, actresses to help finish the project.
         Obviously this will be via the rational expression of their
         individual "will to power" - not the ever-present spectre
         of encroaching collectivism!

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; attention observational comedians: JERRY SEINFELD LIVE 
         ON BROADWAY (12am, Fri, BBC2) has "retired" all his old 
         material - why can't you?... catch Michel Gondry's 
         consummate camera trickery with Bjork, Massive Attack and 
         "Lucas With The Lid Off" in MIRRORBALL (1.40am, Fri, C4) - 
         but not that new Chemical Brothers one (or indeed "Music 
         Sounds Better With You"), which he made afterwards... and 
         some spurious anniversary seems to be the excuse for *yet 
         another* WORLD WAR TWO WEEK on C4 (from 7pm, Sat), plus the 
         BBC's backslapping celebration of themselves for employing 
         a DJ who knows a bit about music: JOHN PEEL NIGHT (from 
         6.20pm, Sun, BBC2)... Bank Holiday Monday perks up with two 
         hacking movies: the still-matchless WARGAMES (11.10am, Mon, 
         BBC1), and the franchise-killing SUPERMAN III (1.35pm, Mon, 
         BBC1)... BBC2 devotes a day to what it loosely describes as 
         "the weather" - including meteors, killer viruses, and THE 
         DAY THE EARTH CAUGHT FIRE (2.05pm, Mon, BBC2)... and C5 
         *must* be taking the piss with an entire afternoon themed 
         around THE OSMONDS (from 1pm, Mon)... no, the idea of 
         animated celebs having their problems solved doesn't sound 
         at all like US import "Ask Dr Katz", right down to 
         unconscious title-homage "All Aboard The *Cat* Bus" - just 
         one idea that wasn't funny enough to get its own series, 
         currently languishing in THE COMEDY LAB (11pm, Tue-Thu, 
         C4)... and surely when the "real world" docu-soap clips are 
         called REALITY BITES (12am, Tue-Thu, C4) in the Ben Stiller 
         film of the same name, it's *supposed to be ironic*. Oh, 
         never mind... 

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; yes, we've already said more than enough about SOUTH 
         PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT (imdb: sequel / devil / war 
         / visions-of-hell / vulgarity) - see VCD section for 
         technical review. Perhaps *too* big/ long etc, but when 
         you're dealing with history's rudest musical ever, that 
         kind of seems like nitpicking... plus, it's an unashamedly 
         original alternative to Eddie Murphy's epic convict comedy 
         LIFE (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a> : "Booze, 
         cussing, more cussing, some brutality, and bloody murder by 
         police. That's the first 56 minutes, anyway. And a couple 
         [of] homosexual suggestions. That's about all I can say 
         about the movie.")... or indeed Drew Barrymore's nerd 
         makeover Wedding Singer re-tread NEVER BEEN KISSED 
         (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a> : vulgar maneuvers; 
         adult female in teen boys' locker room ; inhuman cruelty 
         toward a "misfit" girl; posterior exposure - about 40% of 
         each cheek)...
         
         FERROUS PARTICLES' DAY OFF - TECHNICAL REMARKS ON CURRENT
</span><span class="geekmedia">         VCD WAREZ, OBTAINED "FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY"&gt;&gt; as
         suspected by legions of downloaders, those big patches of
         colour in SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT compress very
         nicely; our version had added advantage of Oriental- looking
         subtitles that you can attempt to cross-reference with the
         regularly repeated expletives... constant camera- movement
         in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT doesn't fare quite so well,
         though no motion-sickness was reported, so that's one
         advantage over the big screen... upcoming neo-Porky's comedy
         AMERICAN PIE was slightly disappointing: proper aspect ratio
         and no subtitles, but fuzzy picture, and muffled sound
         distorting on louder scenes... pick of this bunch: a
         subtitled EYES WIDE SHUT (1587M over 3CDs) - contrast way
         better than some VCDs, sound near-perfect apart from barely
         perceptible hum in (frequent) quiet, contemplative scenes.
         Appears to be digitally censored US cinema print, comes in
         professional-looking shrinkwrap with Chinese (?) text on it
         plus catchy tag-line "After learning of his wife's
         flirtatious behaviour, Dr William Harford goes on an odyssey
         of his own"... in an (intended?) nod to the alpha-male of
         gorilla tribes, the guy at the market called pressing-plant
         output (like the Eyes Wide Shut copy) "silverbacks" to
         differentiate from home-recorded CDROMS... conclusion:
         certainly more reliable than pirate VHSs ("It's your
         tracking, mate"), not too pricey to buy (usually UKP10 or 2
         for UKP15) if you'd rather not pay for download times, and pay
         no more than UKP35 for a PlayStation adaptor card:
