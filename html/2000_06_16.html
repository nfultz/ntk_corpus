</span><span class="item">         Oh, so *now* everyone's saying RIP's bad? As the bill enters
         the Lords, the Guardian ("disgraceful"), the Observer ("your
         privacy ends here"), the Financial Times ("objectionable"),
         the Independent ("crass"), the Evening Standard ("a
         nightmare out of George Orwell") and even Computer Weekly
         ("torpedo the bill") finally spotted the deliberate mistakes.
         Jack Straw took up the shaky defence: the idea of "black
         boxes" sending data to the new interception centre from ISPs
         was ridiculous, he wrote to the Times. Hmm. Given that the
         Home Office's own commissioned report described the nature
         of these boxes in some detail, what replacement does he have
         in mind? Encrypted pigeon post? On a second front in the
         Financial Times, his letter pooh-poohed the British Chamber
         of Commerce's estimate of up to 46 billion UKP lost by
         e-commerce skiddadling abroad post-RIP. Nonsense, he said:
         e-commerce only amounts to 0.6% of GDP: less than five
         billion. But the Chamber was talking about over five years,
         Minister; and they were using *your* estimates of a global
         e-commerce marketplace of 800UKP billion by 2005, with a 5%
         hold in the UK (2.5% with RIP in place). Incidentally, your
         estimate's off a bit: IDC research guessed last week that
         the worldwide market would bring in $1700 billion (1100UKP
         billion) in *three* years time. Although frankly, we stopped
         counting after the first billion pounds worth of tax
         revenue. How many black boxes you could buy with that?

         bounces are stranger than others. Take the Redhat developer

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; after apparently being completely taken in by fake
         "extreme wrestling" (as previously exposed by Louis Theroux),
         RUBY WAX'S AMERICAN PIE (10pm, Sun, BBC2) continues its
         (unintentional?) theme of falling for well-known media hoaxes,
         with a visit to Ron Harris, who sells supermodel eggs online:
         <a href="http://www.ntk.net/index.cgi?back=archive99/now1029.txt&amp;line=52#l">www.ntk.net/index.cgi?back=archive99/now1029.txt&amp;line=52#l</a> ...
         in place of virtual reality, the Wachowski brothers settle on
         lipstick lesbianism as the gimmick for their pre-Matrix debut
         BOUND (10pm, Sun, C4)... and Mark Cousins presents a double-
         bill of dated-looking Nic Roeg eroticism, starting with
         obligatory Jenny Agutter nudity yawn WALKABOUT (from 10pm,
         Sun, BBC2)... unamusing "insights" into the nature of comedy
         punctuate an unamusing live set of STAND UP WITH ALAN DAVIES
         (10.40pm, Mon, BBC1)... another great excuse not to hoover, as
         EAT DIRT (9pm, Tue, C4) proposes that dirt and germs are
         essential for a healthy immune system - just like hackers
         highlight vital security flaws, eh kids?... while WHO WOULD
         WANT TO MARRY A MILLIONAIRE? (9pm, Wed, C4) combines all the
         benefits of showing the notorious US publicity backfire, plus
         all the critical distance of a serious documentary... RIVER
         DEEP, MOUNTAIN HIGH (8pm, Thu, BBC1) transplants the usual
         poorly play-tested survival contests to the Lake District -
         hopefully featuring the Ike &amp; Tina Turner wife-beating anthem
         of the same name... it's Terminator rip-off week on C5 - again
         - with Mario Van Peebles playing rogue cyborg soldier SOLO
         (9pm, Thu, C5)... and the BBC celebrates 10 years of THE
         SIMPSONS (6pm, Fri, BBC2) - albeit on a totally different
         channel, notes the show's least enthusiatic fanatic, over at

         everything from "Event Horizon" to "The Fly" - but hey, it's
         *big-screen sci-fi*, as James "Stargate" Spader and Angela
         "Strange Days" Bassett justify some suitably explosive digital
         F/X in SUPERNOVA (<a href="http://www.screenit.com/">http://www.screenit.com/</a>: Lou Diamond
         Phillips plays a medical technician who has sex with Danika,
         becomes obsessed with the alien artifact, and briefly uses
         profanity)... "Back To The Future meets The Sixth Sense" - ie
         "The Sixth Sense, but with some sort of plot" - claims the

         serial-killer / world-series / nurse / alternate-timeline /
         police / aurora-borealis / skeleton / baseball) - a
         superstring-enabled adaptation of the Mike And The [Quantum]
         Mechanics song "In The Living Years"... Sam "Evil Dead" Raimi

         OF GAME (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/">http://www.capalert.com/</a> : immoral cohabitation
         between an unmarried heterosexual couple who engage in all
         manner of behavior), with Kelly Preston in exactly the same
         role, and Kevin Costner as a bloke attempting a "perfect game"
         of baseball, which seems to be similar to the time that guy
         clocked Pacman or something... leaving this week's only major
         dud: Sandra Bullock rehabilitating everything *except her
         career* in ill-judged alcoholism comedy 28 DAYS (imdb: alcohol-

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FEEBDACK&gt;&gt; (In something resembling chronological order, for
         once.) Following the remarkable "Why does the Onion keep
         stealing all our jokes?" allegations from Smeg magazine [NTK
         2000-05-26], keen-eyed STEVEN SNEDKER realised that psychic
         clairvoyance offers yet another explanation: Smeg claim they
         "wrote the original version 3 years ago", yet the line "hot
         sweaty rest-room meeting with pop star George Michael" is
         oddly prophetic of Michael's actual arrest in April 1998:

         - just over two years ago... our "musical soundalike" section
         [NTK 2000-06-02] looks set to return to its regular monthly
         slot (unless we receive more complaints - and soon!), with
         ALAN "HAMILTON" CONNOR wishing he'd mentioned his own
         "crackpot theory" that "Britney's ['Oops I Did It Again']
         derives its chorus melody from Woman In Love as performed by
         Barbara Streisand", and ADRIAN MOULDER contending that the
         Buffalo Girls' "Really Saying Something" was clearly "based on
         NTK favourites DAPHNE AND CELESTE's entire [one-hit] career",
         further noting that D&amp;C's latest release, "U.G.L.Y", "does not
         appear to be a cover of the Pop Will Eat Itself track of the
         same name"... bang up-to-date now, thanks to everyone who
         spotted that a) LineOne is no longer part-owned by News
         International [NTK 2000-06-09] ("the Great Satan used to have
         a one-third stake in us", writes one relieved employee), but
         by United News And Media (ie The Daily Express), and b) that
         the "Transdiffusion" CD [also 2000-06-09] doesn't seem to be
         free either, despite both our claims to the contrary... and
         finally, sightings flooded in for last week's "Confectionery
         Theory" listings of: COLA SMARTIES (opinions range from "More
         boring than ordinary Smarties" to "Shouldn't work, but they
         do"); the previously unsuspected JELLY AND ICE CREAM FRUIT
         PASTILLES ("A bit of a revelation, though making every second
         one the slightly sickly vanilla is a bit much"); "Frozen
         Carbonated Drink" ICE BLAST (not sampled, but now emblazoning
         the side of the "Playstation" ride on Blackpool Pleasure
         Beach); and, finally, NESTLE ROWNTREE BURSTING BUGS, which
         "have been available almost a week from Miles newsagents on
         Cheetham Hill Road in Manchester (they always have the latest
         special editions and newest products!)". "The fun," our
         correspondent writes, "is bursting them - they go like boils
         given the right sort of squeeze between the fingers, the sweet
         red ichor being a bit too thick to truly squirt", eliciting
         the comment "like something just had an orgasm in my mouth"
         from one colleague. NTK regrets that this correspondence is
         now closed...
