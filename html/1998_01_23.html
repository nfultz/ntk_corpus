</span><span class="item">         Trapped in a corner of the doomed browser complex, the
         decimated NETSCAPE troops argue futilely over tactics
         against the spreading Explorer nest. Unable to take it any
         longer, Netscape sales guy FRANK HECKER blurts it out "I
         say we take off and GNU the entire code from orbit!" A
         crazy idea - so crazy that only Hecker and the hardcore
         Linuxen at <a href="http://www.slashdot.org">www.slashdot.org</a> were even considering it. But
         the Netscape board listened - and now they're handing out
         the entire source to Netscape Communicator 5.0 (with
         minimal copyright) to anyone who wants in. From March, if
         you have a C++ compiler, a *very big* compile machine, and
         a few hours to wait for the builds, you too can play
         around, fix bugs, add features, and customise Netscape's
         browser all to hell. The source will be collated and then
         redistributed by Netscape (who will then presumably plug
         all the proprietary code, like Java and RSA stuff, back
         in). And once we've done that, all of us working together
         for the common good, we can climb into these big Gnuscape
         exoskeletons we've built and go kick Gates' ass. Or that's
         the plan. So only question we're left asking is: Is this 
         going to be a standup fight, sir - or just another bughunt?

</span><span class="item">         NEW SCOTLAND YARD's Vice Squad made another well-researched
         foray into Net legislation with the successful prosecution
         of a Net porn site owner under the Obscene Publications Act
         at Preston Crown Court. Well, successful in the sense that
         the man pleaded guilty and may well go to prison. Slightly
         less successful was the spin taken by Superintendent Martin
         Jauch, who, according to the police press release, claimed
         the result showed "a hypertext link on the Internet
         constitutes a publication for the purposes of the Obscene
         Publications Act." That's to say, if you *point* to a page
         that is viewed as obscene, you *yourself* are publishing
         it. Yahoo and AltaVista should expect the knock on the door
         any minute now. Footnote: At a conference a year ago, Mr
         Jauch said that he was not an expert on the Net, but that
         this did not matter in enforcing the law.

</span><span class="item">         At last, someone's found a way to make money out of Net
         publishing. When former AMIGA POWER staffers Stuart
         Campbell and Jonathan Nash stuck their "AP2" tribute page
         online, they must have worried that it would be of little
         interest (or comprehensibility) to non-readers (or non-
         staff) of the deceased Future Publishing mag. Thrillingly,
         they then discovered their entire site - an estimated
         200,000 words - on the cover CD of the current issue of
         EMAP's CU AMIGA magazine, still containing both their
         copyright symbols and the unusual claim that "CU Amiga
         sucks dogs' cocks in hell". Hurry if you want a copy, as
         the authors believe they may be able to: a) sue EMAP for
         two person-years of writer's salaries; and b) get CU Amiga
         injuncted off the shelves. Uberfreelancer Campbell sounds
         more than capable - only this week, he apparently came
         within 14 hours of "sending the bailiffs round" to the
         offices of Edge for late payment on a game review.

         London, 27-29/01/98 - a world of not just arcade coin-ops and
         "cabinets", but also "dark rides", "pushers", "cranes" and
         "redemption" (which means machines with tickets that you swap
         for prizes, rather than the Christian concept of deliverance
         from the bondage of sin). It coincides - perhaps too
         conveniently - with the LONDON PARKS &amp; ATTRACTIONS trade event
         next door - featuring "all aspects of park attractions and
         major rides." Fountains? Slides? Rollercoasters? Benches?

         Supporters of those redoubtable postmodern Mexican freedom-
         fighters (or are they poststructuralist terrorists? Perhaps
         we shall never truly know) are launching a "Zapatista
         Netstrike" on the 29/01/98 at 4.00pm GMT. The plan is to
         stage a virtual "sit-in" of a number of prominent mexican
         Websites - all,  they state, "simbols of the mexican
         neoliberalism". Protesters should enter the URLs provided,
         then repeatedly press the reload button at the appointed
         time to make their point felt. Hmm. Call us neoliberal
         lackeys, but we can't help thinking there are less labour-
         intensive denial of service attacks than this...

         you know who he means. And similarly useful tool for those

         playboy Web designer Matt Jones in the title role of YOUNG
         EINSTEIN (1.30am, Fri, LWT + some regions)... Dani Behr's
         ICE WARRIORS (6.15pm, Sat, ITV) struggle to out-daft
         Gladiators, and hopefully, following last week's Blind Date
         revelations, will have one called Cosmo The Infiltrator...
         if it follows the usual pattern (see current Q Magazine),
         the voting for the MUSIC OF THE MILLENNIUM (6.30pm, Sat &amp;
         7.55pm, Mon-Thu, C4) will actually be unusually skewed
         towards the music of the last six months... it sounds
         promising, but KNIGHTRIDER 2000 (4.15pm, Sun, LWT only)
         eventually ditches the KITT Tranz-Am, David Hasselhof *and*
         the single mothers on which he invariably preyed, clearing
         the road for US-only sequel series Team Knight Rider...
         could the ancients really have written the books of Erich
         von Daniken?, inquires great-looking sci-fi nonsense
         STARGATE (7.10pm, Sun, BBC1)... RADICAL HIGHS (7.15pm, Mon,
         BBC2) confirms it's maybe just a not-so-radical reworking
         of They Who Dare, with a still-welcome look at illegal BASE
         jumping... tragically, among the now-unmade episodes of
         SEINFELD (11.15pm, Tue, BBC2) were plans for "The Surprise
         Claymation Episode" and "The 3-Inch Kramer"... with one

         further into a universe of dull movie rip-offs and terrible
         episode titles... and they say that the "3" in ROBOCOP 3
         (10.40pm, ITV, Thu) isn't an indication of it being the
         third in the series - but merely a mark out of 10...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; At last! It's Aliens and The Abyss done as a period
         costume teenage love story! It's, quite literally, TITANIC
         (MPAA rated: PG-13 for "disaster related peril and
         violence, nudity, sensuality and brief language")... let's
         face it, if Alex "Repo Man" Cox can't even be trusted to
         host that BBC2 movie slot nowadays, who on earth let him
         loose on Rebecca De "cod" Mornay's bizarre Vegas gamble THE
         WINNER (imdb: crime / thriller / comedy)?... botched Irish
         crime thriller I WENT DOWN (imdb: Ireland / UK) has to be
         funnier than John Godber's UP AND UNDER (imdb: comedy /
         rugby), if only because the former *doesn't* have Neil
         Morrissey, Samantha Janus, Tony Slattery, Griff Rhys Jones,
         and that fat bloke off 2.4 Children... the guy who did Jean
         de Florette and Manon Des Sources (and, er, Germinal)
         agonises over meaningful WW2 drama LUCIE AUBRAC (imdb:
         French)... and romantic-comedy curiosity of the week:
         Russell "LA Confidential" Crowe and Salma "Mrs Robert
         Rodriguez" Hayek are the *only characters* in the vignettes

         MINI EGGS, which, after the Astros debacle, are still the
         Cad's only successful foray into the sugar-coated solid-
         choc market... of course, that territory rightly belongs to
         NESTLE'S SMARTIES, who, for the first time, have hit back
         with their own MINI EGGS, in both GIANT SMARTIES and MILKY
         BAR variants, implying that the words "Mini" and "Egg" are
         so generic that they cannot be registered as trademarks. In
         case that's true, NTK has registered minieggs.co.uk and
         will sell it to the highest bidder - in eggs!... missing
         the point a little, MARKS AND SPENCERS have created an
         edible TAMAGOTCHI choccy egg (packaging shows the
         nyorotchi, ginjirotchi and kuchipatchi that you may find -
         and eat - inside)... plus, last we checked, they're still
         dumping post-Xmas stocks of their edible TRIVAL PURSUIT and
         POP QUIZ board games... elsewhere in confectioning, the
         major turf war fought with the soggy biscuits of the
         unfortunately named OSCAR SPUNKMEYER versus flapjack
         newcomers THE FABULOUS BAKIN' BOYS hots up with the news
         that Kentucky Fried Chicken get their muffins from an
         operation rejoicing in the name of FRANK BRADY'S
         INGESTIBLES... back with savouries, M&amp;S patron saint ST
         MICHAEL gazed enviously upon WAITROSE's ingenious PIZZA
         WRAP (soft base, grill for 3-4 mins, available in cheese &amp;
         tomato or cheese &amp; smoked bacon), then miraculously created
         his own PIZZA METRO (stonebaked, oven cook 8-10 mins,
         available in mozzarella &amp; tomato or the frankly surreal
         potato, bacon &amp; onion). Pizza Wrap still has the edge,
         despite Pizza Metro boasting this intriguing warning:
         "IMPORTANT: A CHARACTERISTIC OF THIS PRODUCT IS ITS
         IRREGULARITY. THIS DOES NOT AFFECT ITS EATING QUALITY."
         Bon appetit!
