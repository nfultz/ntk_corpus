         days, when the news that Uncle Cliff finally flogged DEMON
         INTERNET hits the headlines. For it was plucky, regional
         SCOTTISH TELECOM who snapped the plucky, but getting a bit
         bored of pluckiness, ISP from the sweaty hands of the
         telephone giants. Weirdly, rumour has it that the big
         telcos (names mentioned in the wooing were BT and NTL) were
         actually offering more cash than the canny Scots, but,
         idiosyncratic to the end, Demon went with the outsider. Now
         all that remains is for the shares to be handed over. Which
         presents a slight problem for the higher circles of the
         inferno - what about all the share options owned by the
         rest of the Demon staff? Current price offered: twenty quid
         a share. But what if they all say "noo"?

         to Navigator, as pledged, instead. Hysteria in the Free
         Software community followed, mostly at Jamie Zawinski's
         monster Mozilla party in downtown SF. NTK reporters were
         there to watch JWZ "liberate" the rest of the commercial
         software he had in his cubicle by throwing CD-ROMs at the
         slavering audience, while huge monitors showed a cat of the
         C/C++ code. Also noted: "more girls than you'd expect". Of
         course, all the real fun was going on elsewhere - with the
         Anglo-Australian transworld Cryptozilla coding tag-teams,
         who, just fifteen hours after the code release, had plugged
         back in the strong cryptography support that the US
         government had demanded Netscape strip out. You see what

</span><span class="item">         USENET spammers were struck a near-fatal blow this week, as
         the amassed forces of antispamdom (new word) got bored and
         went home. From today, the cancelling anti-spam bots that
         guard USENET from the more outrageous mass-mailers will be
         turned off, allowing spam to flood the system as much as it
         wants. It remains to be seen whether USENET will crash,
         quite literally, in flames, or the spammers will notice
         that no-one's listening anymore and move on to a more
         effective medium, like jamming teletext broadcasts or
         something. In the meantime, we recommend you retire to your
         mailing-list bunkers until the fallout has cleared. This
         has been a public service announcement.

         the demise of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi's favourite Web design
         house AMX DIGITAL were vindicated Thursday when
         "voluntarily liquidation" spontaneously occurred. Top Falco
         goes to the anonymous source who sent an eerily prescient
         tip back in mid-February. Of course, the ravings that
         accompanied it - suggesting that the liquidation would be
         followed by an instant reforming of the company under a
         different name - must be discounted as wildest speculation.
         But then, what do we know? We thought AMX were the guys who
         did the mouse for the BBC Micro. And who is RealTime, and
         why would they want 80% of the new company? Does anyone
         know? No. Still, eh? Falcoooooooooo!

         Highlander-style "Immortals" battle to try and cut each
         other's heads off, THE GATHERING remains our favourite of
         the giant Scandinavian demo parties, if only because it's
         the only one we've ever been to. Like last year, it's held
         in the Vikingskipet (Viking Ship) Olympic skating stadium,
         Hamar, Norway (short train ride from Oslo), from Wed
         08/04/98 to 12/04/98. Specialist compos include Amiga 64K
         intro, Amiga 4K intro, PC 64K intro, PC 4K intro, PC Text-
         mode demo, C64 Demo, Java demo, Useless utility and (our
         favourite) the Totally Wild Compo.

         answer: their new RELAYONE service lets you send your e-
         mail to a postal address, but it takes "up to" 24 hours to
         get into the envelope - and that's before it enters the
         uniformed routers of the PO's snailmail network. And none
         more expensive, either: 1.50UKP for a single A4 sheet.
         Messages can be sent to UK addresses only. Best bit:
         "RelayOne takes the matter of security very seriously
         indeed. That's why we use a sophisticated encryption system
