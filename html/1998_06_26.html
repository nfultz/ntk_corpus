</span><span class="item">         What does the British Net really need? That's right, another
         committee. Having despatched the crypto debate with such
         aplomb, BARBARA ROCHE and the wunderkinder of the Department of
         Trade and Industry are now proposing an independent panel to
         "investigate complaints over material on the Internet". The
         body's brief will be confined to civil disputes - in other
         words, copyright and libel. And how, exactly, will that
         work? No-one knows; least of all the DTI, who it seems are
         once again flying a kite to see who takes pot-shots at it.
         Well, here's a few: one of the defences (we fervently hope)
         against a libel charge is that you're telling the truth. So,
         if the committee is supposed to decide what is libellous and
         what is not, will it also have powers to investigate and
         call witnesses? Or will it require that sites be shut down,
         before they have their day in court? And if, as supportive
         groups (like the ISPA and the Internet Watch Foundation)
         claim, this is all to prevent ISPs being found liable by
         third parties, then who is liable when a site is taken down
         illegitimately? It's clear that the panel will act very
         quickly if Sony fingers a warez site, but who does the
         victim of a baaad decision appeal to?

</span><span class="item">         In a unique example of unlocking the stable door
         fractionally before the horse has been rendered into glue, a
         US federal appeal court dropped the injunction on
         Microsoft's Windows 95 this week - 48 hours before they
         stopped selling it anyway. The Windows 98 launch party on
         Thursday was a relatively subdued affair in comparison. In
         comparison with anything. Bill Gates took the stage on 5PM,
         San Francisco time, and ran through the list of new
         improvements to the operating system. Then ran through it
         again, slowly, in case anyone coughed.

         the SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERIC OBSERVATORY. SOHO was responsible
         for the recent batch of Sol-based discoveries and beautiful
         images - including sunquakes, comets crashing into the Sun,
         and the only fart joke we've ever ran (NTK 05/06/98) and
         solar tornadoes. While SOHO had finished its nominal two
         year mission, the ESA had recently extended its funding
         until 2011, in order to cover the expected peak in sunspot
         activity. here's still a small hope for regaining contact,
         but they've been trying for over 24 hours now. No joke here;
         it's all a bit sad.

         that there aren't enough "$" symbols and only two pairs of
         curly brackets. Otherwise, it would be the perfect visual
         editor for Perl. As it is, you'll just have to make do with
         creating parsing Perl poems. As infinitely re-usable and
         free form as the language itself, the set costs $17.50
         (outside US) from that commune of outstanding techsmiths,
         The Perl Journal.

         low-res GAME BOY CAMERA and Sticker Printer due here
         10/07/98 (UKP 40, 50 respectively). If yours remains lost/
         knackered, the COLOUR GAME BOY is slated for November (UKP
         80) - or, for real head-jobs, there's the DATEL GAMEBOOSTER
         (UKP 40, out in July), which plays GB carts on either the
         PlayStation or N64. Obviously near-pointless, but how would
         *you* go about building one: PSX emulates GB in software?
         (And would Sony approve the CD?) Or just take the insides of
         real GBs and feed the video in through the PSX i/o port?

         decides to show the second-round World Cup stuff - so now you
         can watch ENGLAND VS COLUMBIA (7.30pm, Fri, BBC1) like you
         really have something at stake... cool f/x and occasional
         safety tips fan the tedious embers of BACKDRAFT (10.30pm,
         Fri, BBC1)... while John Peel and possibly the world's
         worst chatshow host - Jo Whiley - wallow around GLASTONBURY
         '98 (9pm and 11.15pm, Fri, BBC2)... Bad Taste/ Braindead/
         Meet The Feebles director Peter Jackson wimps out with NZ
         murder frolic HEAVENLY CREATURES (9pm, Sat, BBC2); Kate
         Winslet plays - wait for it - a posh girl... Sunday goes
         gangbusters with Bill Murray and De Niro in MAD DOG AND
         GLORY (10.10pm, Sun, BBC2) - marginally more believable than
         Pacino and Madonna in DICK TRACY (11.05pm, Sun, BBC1
         optional)... it's good to talk, but chaffeuring hookers is
         better, discovers Bob Hoskins in excellently grim MONA LISA
         (10pm, Sun, C4) - like The Crying Game, with plot... and,
         finally, from the home of the Mafia comes projectionist
         weepie classic CINEMA PARADISO (12.45am, Sun, C4)... THE
         MOTHERSHIP CONNECTION (2.35am, Mon, C4) looks at
         African-Americans in sci-fi - like that funny bit in Chasing
         Amy?... Coogan's run ends with the clarion cry: I'M ALAN
         PARTRIDGE (9pm, Tue, BBC2) - then cleverly avoids
         typecasting by voicing the car-obsessed AUTOEROTIC (2.40am,
         Tue, C4)... tape the first bit and wipe Woody Allen's early,
         sporadically funny TAKE THE MONEY AND RUN (12.15am, Tue,
         BBC1)... cute Connected columnist Vanessa Collingridge
         continues C5's ratings-driven porn trend with subtly-titled
         docu SEX LIFE (9.50pm, Tue, C5)... it's final cut for Barry
         Norman in repeated FILM 98 (12.30pm, Wed, BBC2) - if you
         were too busy watching Anna Friel last Sun... springtime
         for Mel Brooks in his last genuine comedy, THE PRODUCERS
         (12.50am, Wed, BBC1)... while the real victims of "new
         cruelty" sketch show BARKING (11.25pm, Wed, C4) have to be -
         you've guessed it - anyone trying to watch it...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; yes, it's another Alien/ The Thing/ The Relic remake
         - what d'you expect from a film called MIMIC? (imdb: sci-fi
         / horror / thriller / virus / dissection / giant-insect /
         epidemic / cockroaches / subway / shoes ) But, unlikely
         bio-theory aside, it's quite a viable mutation... again, no
         real stretch for Jennifer Aniston in soppy hetero-conversion
         feel-gooder THE OBJECT OF MY AFFECTION (imdb: romance /
         comedy / gay / based-on-novel / drama)... another My Bloody
         Shirley Valentine for Julie Walters and Brenda Blethyn,
         hitting Vegas for their last GIRL'S NIGHT (imdb: comedy /
         drama)... PALMETTO (imdb: thriller / mystery) sounds like a
         chocolate box selection - which'd be more interesting
         viewing than Woody Harrelson and Elisabeth Shue in this flop
         Florida noir... going to 'Nam worked for dad Martin Sheen
         (Apocalypse Now), and brother Charlie (Platoon), but not
         Emilio Estevez in family flashback effort THE WAR AT HOME
         (MPAA rated: R for "a war-related shooting, an intense
         sequence of violent threat, and for language")...

         predict when failures will occur in the wheels and
         suspension of high-speed trains: the answer "about three
         weeks ago" won't do, apparently... not content with basking
         in Bjorn Borg's past glories, the Swedes have statistically
         proved that our greatest contribution to Wimbledon - Dan
         Maskell - was full of it: players aren't more likely to
         fluff the next point after a double fault; new balls don't
         help: cliche after cliche fails to scrape over the
         mathematical net... an in-depth Cornell research study
         reveals why eggs explode in the microwave (they do? let's
         try)... maybe now they've discovered feathered dino fossils
         in China, that whole birds&lt;&gt;dinos argument will finally go
         extinct... get ready for history-making as REALLY BIG PDFs:
