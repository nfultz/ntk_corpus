</span><span class="item">         Some more facts of British Net life just got "clarified" by
         the courts. Witness TOTALISE vs Motley Fool and Interactive
         Investor a case decided this Feb, but only out in the law 
         reports last week. It was here that a court decided that the
         full details of an anonymous poster (who was slagging off
         the ISP) should be handed over to the court for a civil
         libel case. A few matters of interest to the average
         ISP-slagging NTK reader (especially the anonymous ones: you
         know who you are). First: the court decided that Motley and
         II could not protect their sources as newspapers can,
         because they imposed no editorial control over their forums.
         So British law now says UK Websites can be sued for libel
         (because they are publishers) and be compelled to hand over
         personal details (because they aren't). Nice. Also, this
         decision should apply to ISPs as well as Websites. So in
         winning this battle, Totalise will have opened itself and
         other ISPs to endless fishing by libel litigants attempting
         to track down whistle-blowers by looking up their dial-up 
         details. Well done. And finally, as UKCRYPTO regular Donald
         Ramsbottom noted, if the courts have this much power to
         compel disclosure: why did they ever need RIP in the first
         place?

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         After watching Thursday's TONIGHT show on ITV, it's hard not 
         to sympathise with Carol Vorderman's single-handed crusade 
         against poorly labelled chatrooms, a shadowy world where 
         children using yahoo.com, apparently "the second most popular 
         web provider in Britain", are just "three clicks of the 
         computer mouse away" from predatory paedophiles. In fact, it's 
         no longer just Carol on the case, angrily waving her notes and 
         yelling "It's not good enough!" as Roland Perry tried to 
         explain that pesky American obsession with "free speech", and 
         indignantly concluding "So, it's *your* responsibility as a 
         parent to be educated about the net and then constantly check 
         every site your child will visit [...] - not [the Internet 
         industry's] responsibility to censor, but yours." Of course, 
         you never know who you're talking to in online chats - it 
         might even be "brilliant technology journalist" Richard Barry, 
         who's been helping Carol out the past few weeks by posing as a 
         naive 12-year-old girl. Barry may be best known to NTK readers 
         as the guy who, writing a games round-up for The Guardian in 
         1998, reported without question a week-old April Fool about a 
         Star Wars/ Star Trek crossover - exactly the sort of thing 
         which might indeed be believed by a naive 12-year-old girl.

          - yeah, we're just jealous of Barry's male-model good looks
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Meanwhile, the cognitive distance between the free Net and
         the "free press" stretches further. Following a bit of 
         entrapment by the Harrow Trading Standards crew in June, 
         WHSmith recently got fined six grand for selling a copy of 
         PC Zone with a "grossly violent" KINGPIN demo on it.
         WHSmith has now, in a characteristically brave stance,
         demanded that all magazine CD covermounts be ELSPA-rated. No
         exceptions. Given that ELSPA ratings were originally
         invented to *prevent* software having to pass obligatory
         BBFC ratings, this looks like feeping creaturism to us - but
         whatever we think, they should have some highly weird
         side-effects. Apart from the terrifying onus now on
         publishers to actually discover what's on their free CDs
         (see NTKs passim on the STUART CAMPBELL vs EMAP affair), we
         look set for some amusing badging of serious tech journals.
         Mags like PCW and MacUser, for instance, will now be obliged
         to appear with a "Suitable for Ages 3+" ELSPA label. Always
         assuming an Office XP demo won't include depictions of
         "humiliation", "offensive gestures" and "death or injury to
         human-like or animal-like characters".

         Java client-server 2) Nice GUI 'n' shit 3) Dangerously
         complex multi-user interactions, and 4) MP3 ripping and
         burning. Okay, so we lied about 4) - nonetheless the
         generically-named WEBCDWRITER/WEBCDCREATOR is definitely a
         rare treat, even in that domain. The WebCDwriter bit runs as
         a daemon on a Linux box with a CD writer attached, and
         allows remote users (using their Java-y browsers) to copy
         files, stack up MP3s and wavs, and transfer whole ISOs from
         their own machines to the central CD-burning factory. The
         java client is particularly impressive (demo available on
         the site). While you'll still need someone to pull the CD's
         out of the server box when they're cooked, it seems a great
         way to run a "voluntary backup" system for offices.

         the Brit awards - though we maintain that, more impressively, 
         you can also do this with the lyrics to "The Bad Touch" by THE 
         BLOODHOUND GANG... reader MARTIN FROST "was struck by the 
         resemblance" between LEANN RIMES' "Can't Fight The Moonlight" 
         (from the Coyote Ugly soundtrack) and AQUA'S "Barbie Girl", 
         and contends that the theme tune to TV's "One Foot in the 
         Grave" is "almost identical" to "Did You Ever Have To Make Up 
         Your Mind?" by the LOVIN' SPOONFUL - the only difference being 
         "the bit where Eric Idle sings the words 'one foot in the 
         grave'"... while repeat offender ADRIAN MOULDER "genuinely 
         believed" that the new song from AT THE DRIVE-IN constituted 
         the return of '90s shouters CARTER USM, and that he'd heard 
         JONATHAN WILKES' "Just Another Day" - lyrics include "You're 
         not alone we're all together / Night and day, sunshine and 
         rain" - as the backing music for a Mars Bar ad "about 20 years 
         ago"... which just leaves the homebrew big-beats of the 
         groovily named SHELDON SOUTHWORTH, who did the "Eminem vs Bob 
         The Builder" and "Weakest Link" tracks, but tragically fell 
         foul of our near-total "All Your Bases" blackout when he tried 
         to draw our attention to his "trance mix" of this once 
         fashionable meme. Fortunately he's now redesigned his site in

         remixes <a href="http://www.diffusionuk.freeserve.co.uk/tvthemes.htm">http://www.diffusionuk.freeserve.co.uk/tvthemes.htm</a> , 
         including his Fatboy Slim-esque "147 Lockdown" rework of the 
         BBC2 Snooker tune, and a drum and bass "Dad's Army". Please 
         note that NTK remains wildly uninterested in any other "All
