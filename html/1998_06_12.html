</span><span class="item">         Penny for the packet! As if Northern Ireland hadn't
         suffered enough, BT announced a new bare-bones Internet
         service to be trialled there this Summer. No e-mail, no
         newsfeed, no Webspace, but no charges - apart from a measly
         one pence extra on every minute you call; peanuts to a
         light Net user like yourself. Charges will be billed to the
         calling number's bill - so expect to see spammers armed
         with acoustic couplers at your local phonebox. Stunned
         "industry consultants" blustered about reporting BT to
         Oftel for their devilishly monopolistic scheme - apparently
         unaware that it was practically Oftel's idea in the first
         place. The watchdog predicted this sort of service over a
         year ago, giving it the nod on the understanding that the
         smarter ISPs would grab a Telco license, and undercut it
         with free IP provision when they started receiving telco-
         ish revenues from the phonecall charges. ISPs like, say,
         Easynet, who - just coincidentally - activated their
         telephony system days before the BT announcement. Looks
         like *somebody* made the connection.

</span><span class="item">         AOL finally paid $287 million up front for MIRABILIS.
         Hardcore ICQers protested that this meant they were now
         AOLers - an effective demotion (in official Net pecking
         hierarchy, ICQers are slightly above AOLers while still
         below IRCers, MUDders, and Koko the signing Gorilla). AOL
         was quick to deny a complete merger, saying that they
         considered ICQ merely a "portal" to the Windows desktop.
         Can't knock the theory, although with all the security
         flaws in ICQ, it looks like it's *everybody's* portal to
         your desktop. Our recommendation for the next AOL purchase
         - ICKill, a ICQ script-kiddy exploit which purports to
         allow users to spam other ICQers, but in fact installs a
         permanent backdoor into the spammers' system, allowing it
         to be remotely controlled by ICKill's programmer. 35,000
         unwitting users so far, and growing every day!

</span><span class="item">         More Brit buy-outs: in an intriguingly reversal of his
         namesake's baby-splitting strategem, DR SOLOMON and his
         cohorts have merged with Philistines NETWORK ASSOCIATES
         (producers of the arch-enemy McAfee NetShield and
         VirusScan) for a cool $640 million stock swappage. Not a
         bad price for the company McAfee used to call "Dr
         Dolittle". In another awkward fit - perhaps a fit of panic
         at Amazon's imminent arrival here - WHSmiths bought out the
         Internet Bookshop for UKP 9 million - less than the
         recommended retail price, we'd say. And what are WHSmiths
         going to do with it? If their real world shops are anything
         to go by, they'll dump everything except the big cookery
         hardbacks, stick all the interesting stuff in a corner
         that's too crowded to browse comfortably, then put all the
         batteries behind a secure firewall in case people try and
         shoplift all the electricity.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; LOST IN SPACE (7.15pm, Fri, BBC2) concludes with
         Blake's 7 fans, as does INVASION: EARTH (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1)
         - with *about* 7 fans! [chortle]... John "Dark Star"
         Carpenter takes a peek IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS (10.25pm,
         Fri, BBC1) and finds people going mad from reading books -
         a human variant of the "Good Times" virus? - and part of a
         new BBC Friday horror double-bill, unbelievably called
         "Fright-day"... of all the movies the Beeb *should* be
         showing in widescreen, why not Ridley Scott's postponed
         BLACK RAIN (10.20pm, Sat, BBC1), rather than lame yuppie
         "comedy" wallow CLUELESS (9pm, Sat, BBC2)?... "blah-blah-
         Tarantino gritty-no-music failed-heister" was just what we
         said about DOG DAY AFTERNOON (9.55pm, Sat, C5) when it was
         last shown on C4 back in January... Sontaran-necked Mark
         Kermode breathes heavily over 25 YEARS OF THE EXORCIST
         (10.30pm, Sat, BBC2), then of course they're not allowed to
         show it... FLASH GORDON's alive! (3.30pm, Sun, some ITV) -
         more than can be said for many of those involved, like, er,
         Freddie Mercury... those pesky asteroids are back in Arthur
         C Clarke adaptation TRAPPED IN SPACE (8.55pm, Sun, BBC2)...
         and here's hoping for plenty of commercial breaks in
         Italian arthouser THE ICICLE THIEF (12.50am, Sun, C4) -
         about a director annoyed by irritating TV ads... a slightly
         more haunting depiction of autism in kiddie drama HOUSE OF
         CARDS (10.20pm, Sun, C4) than, say, cult radio adaptation
         SPOONFACE STEINBERG (9.50pm, Tue, BBC2) - see also the
         CHILDREN'S HEALTH (10.20pm, Thu, BBC2) series focusing
         (briefly!) on Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (are
         they deliberately taunting sufferers by regularly changing
         the name?)... James Earl Jones does hilarious Darth Vader
         cameo in cute historical courtroom romp SOMMERSBY (8pm,
         Mon, BBC2)... new six-part series BEG TO DIFFER (11.30pm,
         Mon, C4) promises to be both "irreverent" *and*
         "satirical"... and over on satellite, the SLIDERS (9pm,
         Mon, Sky1) arrive on "unused sets from Timecop" world...
         while STAR COMMAND (10pm, Mon, SciFi) may be the "4th
         bloodiest sci-fi film ever", with 1,200 confirmed kills
         ( <a href="http://magi.com/~rhdf/scms/scms.html">http://magi.com/~rhdf/scms/scms.html</a> )... reassuringly,
         it's the original version of the best film ever, BLADE
         RUNNER (11.10pm, Tue, most ITV) - according to my memory
         implants, somehow even more authentic than the supposedly
         authentic "Director's Cut", if you know what I mean...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; it's offbeat family saga time! Best (and longest) is
         Robert Duvall producing, directing, writing and starring as
         Jesus-filled preachin' machine THE APOSTLE (imdb: drama /
         religion / minister / pentecostalism)... Pfeiffer, Lange
         and Jason Leigh are sisters battling over King-Lear-alike
         A THOUSAND ACRES (imdb: drama / based-on-novel / pulitzer-
         prize-source / sibling-rivalry)... and it's African-
         American clans "Waiting To Ingest" some of that tasty SOUL
         FOOD (MPAA: rated R "for some strong sexuality and
         language")... not a big Hollywood week elsewhere either:
         somehow the fact that it's a Brit-made costume spoof
         undermines STIFF UPPER LIPS (imdb: "co-produced by Isle of
         Man Government")... check out the racy settings of multiple
         partner-exchange fest THE BIG SWAP (imdb: "Locations:
         Bristol, Clevedon, Weston-Super-Mare")... while Leicester-
         set 1970s coming-of-age athleticism tries to keep up with
         THE GIRL WITH BRAINS IN HER FEET (imdb: drama / comedy)...
         so, our surprise recommendation: the witticism-packed
         script of ungrammatically titled rom-com HOTEL DE LOVE
         (imdb: "Australian")...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         CORRIGENDA, ADDENDA, ETCETERA&gt;&gt; You'd think we'd get this
         one right; in response to last week's bite-the-hand-that-
         feeds-us VIRGIN NET piece [NTK 05/06/98], David Clarke
         (Managing Director, Virgin Net - uh *oh*) writes to point
         out that contrary to our snipe, Virgin Net's "three month
         trial ended in February 1997!" and request that Danny now
         be escorted from the building. Fortunately, the Chief
         Financial Officer of the ISP steps in with this career-
         saving justification: "If you did the free monthly trial,
         and then switched to our annual package (12 months for the
         price of 10) you would, indeed, still get three months
         free." Exactly what we meant to say - and what great value,
         eh, readers?... No such sparring from similarly-dissed
         PIPEX, who in a weird synchronicity, cancelled Dave's e-
         mail account a day after we ran a PIPEX bounces mail story.
         Apologies for any errors accessing tips@spesh.com at this
         time... NORTEL deny their Digital Powerline generates

         a SWR meter like to indulge us in some fact-checking?...

         between the company's press release and his X-Files
         episode... in NTK 08/05/98, we said that DOS browser
         Arachne couldn't do frames. It can, and we've felt guilty
         ever since... as we have over the numerous complaints from
