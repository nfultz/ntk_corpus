</span><span class="item">         For several weeks now, London has been abuzz with questions
         about the "WHO IS LUPO?" baby posters. Questions like: what
         shit idea of a teaser campaign is this? Didn't these idiots
         give up after that "Who is Dave Matthews" embarrassment?
         And, of course, I wonder how bad the fake grassroots website
         is? As you'd imagine, whoislupo.com is exactly what an
         amateur investigation into the Lupo phenomenon would look
         like - if, say, it were designed by an ad agency who learnt
         about viral marketing about three weeks ago. "Try the links
         to these amazing sister sites we've discovered", offers the
         peculiarly well-branded front page, pointing to utterly
         independent offerings at <a href="http://www.whoislupo.com/japanese">www.whoislupo.com/japanese</a> and
         <a href="http://www.whoislupo.com/usa">www.whoislupo.com/usa</a> . Or why not try our our Flash games?
         But don't, whatever you do, actually take the hint and *do*
         a whois lookup on whoislupo.com. Because then you'll find
         out it's created by a Nathanesque Islington Web design
         company that delivers "innovative concepts and scalable
         back-end solutions across a diverse range of industries" -
         including Volkswagen, makers of the Lupo car. Which anyone
         using Google would have discovered weeks ago.

</span><span class="item">         Information wants to be free: unless, of course, it's
         government information. In that case, with good behaviour,
         it could be out of chokey in five years. The Lord Chancellor
         and Grand Moff Irvine announced this week that the
         implementation of this new-fangled Freedom of Information
         Act is to be postponed until 2005 - three years after it was
         expected to start. The next few years will be usefully
         filled by government departments explaining what sort of
         thing they *will* be revealing, just as soon as they've
         checked for it behind the sofa. Canada, Ireland - heck, even
         Bosnia and Poland took less time than this to organise their
         FOIAs. The problem is: will the floodbanks hold until then?
         With the judiciary siding with those who use the Data
         Protection Act to grab their government files, and everyone
         and their mate mining what .gov.uk sites there are, who is
         now to stop a "Statistics Office In Exile" site, which could
         collate the unavoidable trickles of data into just the
         cohesive mass that the government doesn't seem to want let
         out? Hell, if the government wants companies to keep
         centralised permanent data on every citizens' doing, isn't
         it time that someone did the same to them?

</span><span class="item">         With the advertising and publishing industries healthier than
         they've ever been - plus of course the stunning lack of "cyber
         lifestyle" content available on the internet - now would
         indeed appear to be the perfect time to relaunch BLACK ICE,
         Brighton's answer to Mondo 2000 magazine (which, for those of
         you who don't - or choose not to - remember the early '90s,
         was kind of like "Wired", but less sane). "The first issue is
         filling up fast", reveals creator and visionary MARK BENNETT -
         though there are still opportunities (and maybe even a budget)
         for writers, photographers, illustrators, copy editors, ad
         managers, web designers and all-round "information omnivores"
         to contribute to its - sometimes almost achingly nostalgic -
         brand of cutting-edge futurism. But get those submissions in
         quickly - it's been 9 years since the previous print edition,
         so if you miss the issue 2 deadline, issue 3 might not appear
         until the year 2010, by which time we could all be keeping up
         with the latest high-tech trends via instantaneous computer
         communication networks, or something.

         Hyde Park, London) - they've now moved on to protesting
         against the inevitable ethnic infighting caused by installing
         an oil-export-friendly puppet administration in Afghanistan,
         the patriotism-fuelled restriction of civil liberties in this
         country, and the potential expansion of the conflict to Iraq.
         Christ, some people are never happy. Of course, you shouldn't
         even be reading this if you're already taking part in today's
         IRELAND OFFLINE web boycott, intended to highlight the high-
         tech magnet's alleged 3000% percent markup in dialup pricing -
         and lack of broadband or unmetered services - compared to the
         UK. All in all, perhaps the perfect opportunity to catch this
         year's LEONID METEOR SHOWERS (this weekend, various venues) -
         assuming that they *are* in fact meteors, and not "Day Of The
         Triffids"-style satellite weapons platforms dumping their
         payloads in the upper atmosphere.

         Christy Turlington out of porn GIFs; to Image Analogies, a
         staggering demonstration of where equations can get you when
         you throw them at a Van Gogh painting. It's all there, in
         one convenient archive. As opposed to dragged out

         to CHILDREN IN NEED NIGHT (from 7pm, Fri, BBC1) with Arnie-
         free innercity slaughterfest PREDATOR 2 (10pm, Fri, C5)...
         Iain "The 11 O'Clock Show" Lee continues to deny his inner
         nerd in intriguingly rebranded "Bits - Minus Two Of The Girl
         Presenters" videogame show THUMB BANDITS (11.25pm and 1.45am,
         Fri, C4)... and, searching the poorly-publicised listings for
         ROCK PROFILE NIGHT (from 10.15pm, Sat, PlayUK), we stumbled
         across the curiously low-profile "from the makers of TVGoHome
         (soon to be its own TV show)" website adaptation UNNOVATIONS
         (10.20pm, Fri, PlayUK)... the hideous "Rock Profile"-style pop
         caricatures continue on Sat, when a former Take Thatter
         becomes a bland Frank Sinatra impersonator in ONE NIGHT WITH
         ROBBIE WILLIAMS (9pm, Sat, BBC1), while Cliff Richard sings
         songs that were hits for others during his epic career,
         including a scorching "God Save The Queen"/ "Anarchy In The
         UK" medley of classics by the Sex Pistols... fleeing this
         titanic ratings clash, everyone else gives up with efforts
         like I LOVE BLUE PETER (9pm, Sat, BBC2), and period medical
         mystery yawn THE MADNESS OF KING GEORGE (8.15pm, Sat, C4) -
         both lacking the true historical significance of OMNIBUS:
         CHUCK JONES - MR BUGS BUNNY (8.10pm, Sat, BBC2)... the BBC
         tackles those "dumbing down" accusations head on in ROLF
         [HARRIS] ON ART (6.55pm, Sun, BBC1), to be followed by
         "Jeffrey Archer's Guide To Great Literature" and "S Club 7's
         History Of Classical Music"... and Mon is overrated cult movie
         night, with both EASY RIDER (1am, Mon, C4) and RESERVOIR DOGS
         (10pm, Mon, C4) - "Let me tell you what Madonna's 'Into The
         Groove' is about: it's about Luke Skywalker attacking the
         trench on the Death Star"... there's a Japanese special of
         animation anthology HOT REELS (12.05am, Tue, C4)... NTK staff
         don't appear until the final episode of "I Love Our Liberated
         Modern Age" nudity clip-show TABOO (9.50pm, Wed, BBC2)... Mick
         Jagger debates the ending of his "Enigma" movie in BEING MICK
         (9pm, Thu, C4)... and middle-class psychotic Jimmy Carr,
         former host of "Drunk Review" on E4's short-lived "Show Me The
         Funny", presents COMEDY LAB's promising "World Of Corporate
         Video" (11.55pm, Thu, C4)...

         secretly-gifted wizard messiah who excitingly flies around

         films - like that's going to stop you going to overlong CGI
         posh kids irritant HARRY POTTER AND THE FRANCHISER'S DREAM
         (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/harrypottersorc.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/harrypottersorc.htm</a> :
         Christmas without Jesus; magic to grow tail on a boy; boy
         conversing with a snake; one of the characters is 665.5 years
         old; ingenious planning and outstanding attention to detail
         rivaling commercial nuclear power production; and all to
         present evil as good)... annoyingly, the alternatives aren't
         much better, despite the supposed acclaim for teen "American
         Beauty"/ "Daria: The Movie" comic-book aimlessness GHOST WORLD
         (<a href="http://www.screenit.com/movies/2001/ghost_world.html">http://www.screenit.com/movies/2001/ghost_world.html</a> : Enid
         [Thora Birch] shows some cleavage; Enid tears up a notice and
         throws it to the ground; Enid briefly sports a multi-colored
         dye job in her hair)... and completing the "pesky kids" theme,
         two vaguely incestuous coming-of-age limited releases: DISCO
         PIGS (<a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk/">http://www.bbfc.co.uk/</a> : rated 15 for coarse language
         and some strong violence and sexual references) and MY BROTHER
         TOM (imdb comment: utterly facile, regressive, self-indulgent,
         anti-establishment, anti-civilisation juvenilia)...
