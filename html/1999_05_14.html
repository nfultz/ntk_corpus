</span><span class="item">         As lists of SECRET INTELLIGENCE SERVICE spies go, it wasn't
         exactly the most credible. Its source (allegedly) was an
         agent who'd barely completed his training. As well as names
         and dates, it included additional information like "wanker"
         (potential weakness, or special skill?). And it appeared on
         Lyndon LaRouche's site - tucked between tirades on how
         Prince Philip runs the world heroin trade, and how Tony
         Blair's government tricked the US into war with Iraq. Even
         they seemed unsure of it: it had vanished by Wednesday. At
         that point, the only person who ever seemed to have spotted 
         it was harmless Usenet eccentric Raymond Amundson, who
         reposted it in a flurry of noise on alt.talk.royalty ("O
         Geez...even the loony bin is HOSTILE to me.", added
         Amundson, clarifying his reputation). And this, no doubt, is
         where it would have languished - had the Secret Intelligence
         Service not abruptly announced to all media to definitely
         NOT look for or publicise a list which they exclusively revealed
         "identifies a large number of SIS (MI6) officers". Oh, and
         certainly don't look for a list with around 110 names on it.
         And don't look on a Website in America. Astoundingly,
         instead of running standard disinfo tactics to delay the
         spread of the list as they quietly shifted the agents out of
         harm's way, the SIS actively confirmed the story, then
         encouraged thousands of Net users to seek out, mirror, and
         propagate this juicy bit of info. Not very
         intelligent, not much of a service to anyone. And not, any
         more, very secret.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; deranged Euro co-pro sci-fi LEXX (10.50pm, Fri, C5)
         somehow makes it to a second series... not sure how this
         affects the licensing of BBC's "Record Breakers", but
         GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS (9pm, Fri, ITV) starts as it means to
         go on, with a round-up of the world's freakiest
         disfigurements... and U2's Bono is among those paying
         tribute to the Scandinavian "The Smiths" in THE ABBA STORY -
         THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL (9pm, Sat, ITV)... ROBOCOP 3
         (10.15pm, Sat, ITV) succeeds where OCP and Frank Miller both
         failed, and kills off the movie franchise for good...
         wife-beating martial arts action with Jet Li in THE LEGEND
         OF FONG SAI-YUK I (2.30am, Sat, C4) - did they ever make
         FONG SAI-YUK II?... and it's a bit harsh devoting only 10
         minutes to the best of 4 LATER (10.20pm, Sat, C4)... well,
         obviously science will ultimately explain the arts, but the
         arts can never fully explain science - which should settle
         once and for all which is the best out of THE TWO CULTURES?
         (11pm, Sun, C4)... Bill Maher's overrated topical chat THE
         POLITICALLY INCORRECT SHOW (11.45pm; then 11ish, Mon-Fri,
         C4) spends a week in the UK, and oddly acquires the prefix
         "THE" and postfix "SHOW" in the process... and THE EQUINOX
         SHOW (9pm, Mon, C4) chips in with some helpful hints on
         ethnically targetted bioweapons... as far as we can recall,
         the terrible Van Damme / Minogue / Steven de "Tomb Raider"
         Souza live-action STREET FIGHTER (9pm, Tue, C5) is in fact
         based on the game Street Fighter II - which is presumably
         why they never made a sequel based on the film's own
         spin-off video-game, or they'd have had to call it "Street
         Fighter II: The Movie: The Game: The Movie II" or
         something... ubercomic Simon "League Against Tedium" Munnery
         creates his own ON-digital weirdness slot and calls it THE
         FUTURTV SHOW (9.30pm, Tue &amp; Thu, UK Play)... and, sorry, we
         forgot to plug the planet-of-the-whip-women Space: 1999 last
         week, but enthusiasts can still look forward to a futuristic
         female-dominated society in Gene Roddenberry's one-off
         nonsense fun PLANET EARTH (1.05am, Mon BBC1)... it's US
         government vs cypherpunks in a paintball battle - to the
         death! - in HOSTILE INTENT (9pm, Wed, C5) described by one
         imdb user as "An outrageously fascist movie!", though it's
         unclear whether that's intended as a recommendation...
         Republica's Saffron picks her THE MUSIC OF THE MILLENNIUM
         SHOW (12.20am, Wed, C4) - surely a toss-up between "Drop
         Dead Gorgeous" and "Ready To Go"?... and worthwhile Star
         Trek title sequence compilation THE "THE PLANETS" SHOW (9pm,
         Thu, BBC2) unapologetically extends its remit to tackle that
         notoriously non-planetary satellite, The Moon...

         at last gets his act together for twisty-turny US-set
         neo-noir BEST LAID PLANS (MPAA: Rated R for language and
         sexuality), featuring Reese "Pleasantville" Witherspoon and
         the geeky bomb-making younger brother from Face/Off... the
         real TRUE CRIME (imdb: adultery / journalism /
         lethal-injection / murder / prison / womaniser / zoo /
         capital-punishment / car-crash / death-penalty / death-row /
         failing-marriage) is of course doddery Clint Eastwood
         passing himself off as an irresistible journo Lothario,
         racing against time to save a condemned man (journalists and
         deadlines, eh?) - one for James Woods/ Denis Leary
         completists only... together at last!: Chris Rea, Felicity
         Kendal, John Cleese, Joanna Lumley, Bob Hoskins, the late
         Oliver Reed *and* Michael Winner combine to make
         terminal-illness revenge farce PARTING SHOTS (imbd:
         black-comedy) incomparably strange... and Jackie Chan 1992
         separated-at-birth knock-off TWIN DRAGONS (imdb: concert /
         farce / hong-kong / martial-arts / mistaken-identity /
         twins) is showing its age a bit too... leaving you a tricky
         choice between Lars von Trier's latest controvo-Danish
         art-porn THE IDIOTS (imdb: dogme-95 / cult /
         fake-documentary / essay / experimental / group-sex /
         improvisation / mental-illness / nudity / sex / stupidity /
         community)... which at least has more "spazzing off" than
         touching gay Grange Hill feelgooder GET REAL (imdb: not a
         movie version of the 1998 Lindsay Duncan/ Simon Godley ITV
         sitcom of the same name)... 

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FEEBDACK&gt;&gt; a flurry of responses to our quest for "internal"
         music biz piracy, [NTK 1999-04-23] with MARCUS AUSTIN - of
         "Internet.Works" magazine fame - claiming that the "first 5
         seconds" of Martine McCutcheon's "Perfect Moment" is "When
         Love Breaks Down" by Prefab Sprout, and that The Offspring's
         "Why Don't You Get A Job" is The Beatles' "Ob-bla-di
         Ob-bla-da"... never mind whether the new Chemical Bros
         single is more like the KLF's "What Time Is Love?" or the
         theme from "Knight Rider", argues ADRIAN MOULDER, who's
         spotted even more imaginative soundalikes: Robbie Williams'
         "Strong" (Oasis' "Champagne Supernova"), Westside's "This I
         Swear" (Bette Midler's "The Wind Beneath My Wings"), plus
         "the music off the new Mobil ad with the Tron cars racing
         through the engine is *obviously* off the giant generator
         bit of Total Recall". Moulder concludes that "the so-called
         New Radicals are clearly soluble in the Old Waterboys" and
         further inquires: "are Gay Dad the band off 'A Young
         Person's Guide To Being A Rock Star'?"... forced to
         re-record his old '80s stuff on the discs "Yin" and "Yang",
         Fish out of Marillion was in fact the first person to become
         his own tribute band, contends TONY BLEWS, adding - perhaps
         unnecessarily - that his new album is "a bit of a dog's
         log"... "Surely GEM predates any Microsoft Windows attempt
         by some considerable period?" corrects ANDREW MARSHALL [re
         NTK 1999-04-23 again], adding the laudable disclaimer "My
         brain may be faulty (I am over 40 now, after all)"...
         "Easynet already has a free ISP", asserts SIMON H LE G
         BISSON [re NTK 1999-04-16], poignantly pointing out "they
         took my old baby UKOL free nearly a month ago, without
         telling anyone"... and finally: last week's namecheck of
         Christopher Bidmead prompted widespread unsolicited
         reminiscing over Dr Who episodes, including "Frontios",
         which apparently has characters called "Kerningham and
         Ritchie" in it, plus "Logopolis" itself - "There's a scene
         where Adric has to comb through ten pages of hexadecimal by
         hand to find a bug that's making weird evil things happen,"
         recalls IAN HOLMES, "though why he couldn't have just done a
         'diff' I'm not sure". NTK regrets that this correspondence
         is now closed...
