</span><span class="item">         Is it some coded message between the busy bees of MySociety 
         and the (comparatively) slow-moving Open Rights Group (the 
         latter steadily nearing some way that you can actually send 
         them the money that you may have pledged them last year)? 
         Anyway, MySociety have turned their internal-nagging email bot 
         *inside out* and converted it to an outward-facing web site 
         which will regularly remind you about anything you were 
         planning to do but keep forgetting. Like a cron job for the 
         rest of your life, the site promises to "hassle you roughly" 
         every X days according to what you specify, and even utilises 
         "semi-unpredictable" intervals to prevent you anticipating 
         (and attempting to avoid?) its relentless good intentions. 
         Still, we always like to show some editorial impartiality on 
         MySociety issues - and in this case maintain that the project 
         would be slightly, but significantly, improved if it was 
         renamed "David Hasslebot", in tribute to the calm, slightly 
         camp conscience of the computerised car in "Knight Rider".

</span><span class="item">         You know, we've always wanted to hold an event that Joshua 
         "del.icio.us" Schachter was speaking at - largely so we could 
         introduce him with the Shampoo track of the same name ("You're 
         so old and we're so young/ We're gonna have some fun/ 'cause 
         we want to! [...] Del-icio-us/ Running wild in the city, late 
         at night!"). Sadly, next month's CARSON WORKSHOPS SUMMIT: THE 
         FUTURE OF WEB APPS (10am, Wed 2006-02-08, Kensington Town 
         Hall, London, W8 7NX, UKP75 + VAT) has a slightly more 
         conventional pretext for making him the keynote, commencing a 
         day of mid-priced Web 2.0 cheerleading that also includes Eric 
         "Flickr" Costello, furious Brit blogging apologist Tom Coates, 
         plus a couple of guys from Google. Negotiations are afoot to 
         snag one or more of them for another London GEEK DINNER, 
         though in the meantime Ian Forrester is trying out a slightly 
         more upmarket venue for January's soiree with DAVE "CSS Zen 
         Garden" SHEA (7pm, Mon 2006-01-23, The Crown and Anchor, 22 
         Neal St, London WC2H 9PS, UKP6 for buffet). And for anyone who 
         considers an evening discussing web standards "not quite geeky 
         enough", a new pub night for "computer security enthusiasts" 
         continues at 8pm, next Thu 2006-01-19, upstairs at The Hand 
         And Flower, 1 Hammersmith Road, London W14 8XJ, under the name 
         of DC4420 - seemingly implying it's exactly 1.7 times more 
         hardcore than London 2600?

</span><span class="item">         Despite the naysayers in the recent "My key size is more
         enormous than yours" mini-discussion on Slashdot, the
         (heavily concealed) truth is that TRUECRYPT is probably the
         most actively developed storage encryption system - this
         week at least. Based on the old Encryption For The Masses
         Windows program, it's recently been ported to Linux, and can
         Mac OS X be far away? It has a nice line in "false-bottomed"
         volumes, which means that you can give the password to one
         encrypted volume without revealing the existence of another,
         giving rubber-hosed attackers an excuse to torture you two or
         three times. It can sit around on USB keys and, despite the
         usual cryptowonktastic choice of cyphers, is actually
         reasonably straightforward to use, leaving you time to
         actively do something subversive enough to fill more than 
         a GPGed textfile.

         that includes the shameless fan-pandering of Joss Whedon's 
         "Serenity", despite your protests that it even appeared in the 
         IMDB's "top 250 movies as judged by their regular voters", or 
         that viewers who didn't jump, wince or laugh were "not paying 
         attention" <a href="http://qwer.org/RidiculouslyComplexPermalink.html">http://qwer.org/RidiculouslyComplexPermalink.html</a> . 
         Inexplicably, this $39m triumph only took about $25m at the US 
         box office: <a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=serenity.htm">http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=serenity.htm</a> - 
         in contrast to, say, the much more cinematic "Pitch Black", 
         whose budget and domestic takings were exactly the other way 
         around: <a href="http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pitchblack.htm">http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=pitchblack.htm</a> ... 
         
         On a related note, "[I] humbly suggest that if you need to 
         explain phrases like phony war [NTK 2004-11-12], you're not 
         doing a good enough job of driving away a wider readership", 
         was just one of several reader comments we neglected to 
         mention for the whole of last year. More recently, "Where did 
         you get that from? Nobody I've shown it to believes that BT 
         actually produced it", contested MATTHEW GILLIARD, regarding 
         NTK 2005-08-05's BT Technology Timeline - now nominally 
         accessible at <a href="http://btplc.com/Innovation/News/timeline/">http://btplc.com/Innovation/News/timeline/</a> ; 
         while "Marillion fan, by any chance?" accused MATT GIBSON, 
         following NTK 2004-10-15's use of "Currently residing in the 
         'Where Are They Now?' file", apparently unaware that its 
         appearance in Marillion's 1987 "Incommunicado" is itself a 
         quote from - of course - 1984's "This Is Spinal Tap" ... 
         
         In a similarly nostalgic mood (and apparently apropos of 
         nothing in particular), "What happened to all the kids in the 
         videos such as Madness' 'Baggy Trousers', the little girl in 
         the Smiths' 'Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One 
         Before', and suchlike?", mused ELIZABETH BROWN. "I've always 
         wanted to know where are they now." More practically, "Are 
         you still in touch with anyone like Chuffy! or Snark from 
         [defunct 2002 NTK spin-off] EveryoneHatesAttachments.com?", 
         inquired WOODEN SPOON - well, the simple answer is no, but 
         they (or anyone bizarrely pretending to be them) can always 
         contact us at tips@spesh.com if they'd like to be reunited, 
         using the subject line "NTK - I am someone who used to use
