         NAPSTER, now caught in crossover court cases with Metallica
         *and* Dr Dre. Good to see someone whose early career was
         marked by a disrespect for authority and heavy reliance on
         sampled works (as well as a love for words ending with "z")
         taking out the Napsters with Attitude. And even better to
         see that, while heavy metal and rap still have artistic
         differences, they can unite under one ne attorney - LA's
         Howard King, who is leading both court cases. And we're sure
         that if the music industy mows Napster, Inc down in a legal
         bloodbath, absolutely no-one will step in to take over the
         server duties in an illegit manner. For that would be wrong.

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Who can make Network Solutions look like a model of
         efficiency? ICANN! The beginning of the week saw the "at
         large" ICANN membership discover, painfully, that the member
         announce list was open to subscriber posts. "'ICANN ... to
         assume responsibility for the IP address space allocation,
         protocol parameter assignment, domain name system
         management, and root server system management functions' -
         and they've screwed this up, this badly? Jeesh.", one
         subscriber succinctly commented (to about 12,000 others). At
         the same time, NSI was sliding up to the exhausted tangle of
         committees and slipping over a position paper aimed at
         breaking the current ICANN deadlock over those long-awaited
         extra top level domains. NSI's plan includes whittling it
         down to two new TLDs - .shop and .banc. Note the
         euro-friendly feel of ".banc" and NSI's silky insinuation
         that the whinging European sector of ICANN  should host the
         ".shop" servers. Very clever. Very... political. We also
         note that NSI has picked the two domains most likely to be
         favoured by cash-rich corporations (dropping that whole
         pesky ".union" slab), and naturally suggested themselves as
         willing to support the new domains. Good to see NSI taking
         part in an open discussion of the issues. Especially given
         what we hear about NSI's new Premier Partner program, which
         includes a cause forbidding members from saying anything
         disparaging about the company.

         team sat around until someone else did the research for us.
         Thanks then to Ben "Millennium Winner" Laurie for digging up
         the latest status. Apparently, the European Parliament have
         yay-sayed the ban, and now it's back to the European Council
         to decide what to do with it. File it under "laws which
         won't get implemented by the national governments in a month
         of officially-redefined Sundays". We sincerely hope.

</span><span class="item">         On this day, beloved, we should think of those friends who
         were until recently hammered onto crosses and subjected to
         extended taunting - but who are now back, back, back, shiny
         and new. I'm thinking of QT - the nifty C++ class library
         and former Yoko Ono of open source, now released in a
         transcendental 2.1 form. Updates include a faster HTML
         viewer, an even more Windowsy file dialog, some nice network
         protocol abstraction and a speedier and tighter ship in
         general. The license is okay now from a open source POV, but
         tradition requires that must never develop it with the same
         hand that you have touched a GPL'd program. Oh, and talking
         of untouchable, Andrew Tanenbaum's MINIX OS is now under a
         BSD license. Happy now, Linus?

         Holiday movie bonanza!... Kelsey "Frasier" Grammer's DOWN
         PERISCOPE (6pm, Fri, BBC1) isn't that bad - assuming it's
         not finished already [i don't understand this, dave. it's
         still afternoon in ... oh. oh dear. - danny] ... Madonna
         musical EVITA (8.30pm, Fri, BBC1) doesn't even have a cameo
         from the performer behind the definitive stage
         interpretation of the role, David Essex... and Fish Called
         Wanda followup FIERCE CREATURES (9pm, Fri, ITV) would be
         more amusing if the entire cast were torn apart by Mack
         trucks, as in Rutger Hauer's THE HITCHER (9pm, Fri, C5)...
         "Live And Kicking" seems to have been ditched in favour of
         something called FULLY BOOKED INTERACTIVE (8.45am, Sat,
         BBC1) - hey, it's no "Wonky Donkey"... the TOP TEN COMEDY
         RECORDS (9.15pm, Sat, C4) should be far less annoying than
         Tim Burton's gag-free ID4 spoof MARS ATTACKS (10.15pm, Sat,
         ITV) - more laughs, albeit unintentional ones, in
         recut-from-TV-show [BATTLESTAR] GALACTICA DISCOVERS EARTH
         (4.40pm, Sun, C5)... while FUTURECAST (9pm, Sun, C4) has

         cursed to relive the terrors of her own childhood in remade

         ghetto-chess movies... most confused title-pun of the year
         comes from DESPERATELY SEEKING EUTOPIA (11.20pm, Tue,
         BBC2)... and, while ALISTAIR MCGOWAN'S BIG IMPRESSION (10pm,
         Wed &amp; Thu, BBC1) is indeed a subtly observed improvement on
         satirical '60s throwback Rory Bremner, does that in itself

         Phil Collins and Huey Lewis tracks are in the film, but sadly
         not the soundtrack album... Tim Robbins' rent-paying role in
         last week's "Mission To Mars" ("Where's Woody?" "He - didn't

         incongruous sequel to evil-nanny thriller "The Hand That Rocks
         The Cradle"... bickering with your spouse of 15 years? Then
         it's unclear whether you should or shouldn't take them to
         ailing "Spinal Tap" director Rob Reiner's extended arguing-

         talk with explicit descriptives and adulterous activities 
         provided teasings of the lower levels of AH Maslow's hierarchy

         KEVIN AND PERRY GO LARGE (<a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk">http://www.bbfc.co.uk</a> : Passed '15' 
         for frequent, moderate sexual references and infrequent strong

         "Kiss my [backside]"; urine-soaked snowball; disguised foul
         word; gratuitous flatulence; organized child aggression
         against adult authority; suggestive picture; ghosting of
         female anatomy through clothing; clear theme of trying to make
         any adult look like a buffoon; no noted issues of cult/
         occultism or other issues of great offense to God)... or, a
         record-breaking attempt that never seemed to make it onto the
         Roy Castle/ Norris McWhirter/ Cheryl Baker TV show - the 
         world's biggest gang-bang, as documented in SEX: THE ANNABEL
         CHONG STORY (<a href="http://www.bbfc.co.uk">http://www.bbfc.co.uk</a> : Passed '18' for strong

         now, perhaps understandably, wants to know "What's it for?"...
         last week's dead-tree round-up contained a couple of omissions

         who has "seen but not bought" CLICK IT!, the "family internet

         geeks'," he rages, "but when has there *ever* been a UK
         internet magazine targetted at anorak-wearing speccy geeks?" -
