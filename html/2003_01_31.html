</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         After our jocular "history is repeating itself" motif of last 
         week, we're disturbed to find that 2003 is continuing to 
         increasingly resemble a 1990s megamix. One of the first major 
         cyberrights flaps in the UK was a 1996 piece by THE OBSERVER 
         newspaper, which unfairly declared Clive Feather of Demon to 
         be Britain's "pornographer in chief" - all because Demon had 
         newsgroups with funny names, and The Observer had a picture of 
         Clive looking shifty. The whole thing turned out to be major 
         embarrassment for the truth-seeking, civil-rights-loving 
         Observer, as the paper claimed credit for the shut-down of the 
         first anonymous remailer, anon.penet.fi, and the FBI point-
         blank denied the quotes ascribed to them. The Observer has a 
         short memory, though, and ran the story a second time, back in 
         2000, when, on a slow news day, it reeled once more at the 
         shockingly continuing presence of Demon newsgroups. Still, 
         like the addled Net users we are, we're getting a bit hardened 
         to these sensational exclusives. Which is handy, because this 
         week, they ran the same story again. Admittedly, this time, 
         the names had been changed: it was Easynet now, not Demon, who 
         were "peddling child porn involving incest and bestiality" 
         (ie: running a full newsfeed). Basically, then, The Observer 
         digs out this story roughly every three years, in the hope 
         that nobody notices. It may be worth checking to see if they 
         do that with the rest of the paper, too.

         half-way decent annual challenge on the Web, and by now
         compressimaniacs around the world should be obfuscating
         their javascript at the very thought of fitting a neat game,
         design or flesh-eating worm into 5120 bytes of http-served
         glory. But the 5K's creators have left the building. They're
         spending their time these days hacking on their prospective
         MOO-for-money, The Game Neverending, and they are not coming
         out. Last September, the judges offered the 5K to anyone who
         wanted it - but as yet, nobody has come forward. Any
         volunteers? Would you like to be king of the modern-day demo
         scene? Should we do it? Or should everyone sit outside the
         Neverending's portal, yelling until the founders come out?

         OF CODE: SHAPING THE FUTURE OF THE NEXT INTERNET (from 9.15am,
         Thu 2003-02-06, the Oxford Union, registration from UKP15)
         isn't the same as the similarly named 2001 bash in Cambridge
         which featured a shouting Richard Stallman (for a change).
         Nonetheless, it does promise LAURENCE "Eldred v. Ashcroft"
         LESSIG, ESTHER "Release n.0" DYSON and FIPR's IAN "not the
         Stone Roses" BROWN discussing - and hopefully explaining -
         "IPv6, digital rights management systems, and digital identity
         and authentication technologies". You can catch Stallman,
         meanwhile, at the Free and Open source Software Developers'
         European Meeting FOSDEM 2003 (from Sat 2003-02-08, Universite
         Libre de Bruxelles, Brussels, all talks and tutorials free but
         "donations are welcome"), along with JON "MADDOG" HALL, the
         latter illuminating "The History Of Free Software: From 1300
         AD To The Present Day". Handily, the UK's Linux User Groups
         have set up a mailing list for anyone interested in "exploring
         shared travel/accommodation/sponsorship arrangements" for the
         event - and let's hope that's not all they end up "exploring",
         if you know what we mean.

</span><span class="item">         So, you did something awful in a past life, and now you've
         got to do a proper, businesslike presentation in front of an
         audience of your peers. But how? You don't want to use
         PowerPoint because of those pledges your friends made to
         shoot you if you ever did. Your grungy five-year old clown
         laptop might spontaneously self-immolate as you sweep onto
         the stage - but you don't know what backup hardware they'll
         have running at the venue. You want your presentation to be
         in plaintext so you can hack final tweaks, but you also want
         to be able to stick in those funny pictures you snagged at
         the last minute from Google Images. You don't want to use
         Keynote because your image is of a raw, rough-and-ready
         soothsayer, not a turtlenecked Jobs clone. So what do you
         do? Can we suggest the rarely mentioned, but rather cool,
         presentation feature of the unbrowser, Opera? Pressing F11
         in any version of Opera since v.5.0 will switch the app
         fullscreen, with a new media stylesheet enabled: simple HTML
         pages magically become individual slides, which you can
         flick through using PgUp and PgDown. Opera itself fits in
         under 4MB, so you can stick it on a USB key, or download it
         at your destination. Your presentation is in HTML, so you
         can download that too. Opera's non-free, but hell, it'll run
         on anything - and the ad-supported versions don't show their
         wares in presentation mode. Plus the more people use this
         feature, the (marginally) more likely it will that Mozilla
         and friends will adopt the same useful functionality.
