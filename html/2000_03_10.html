</span><span class="item">         On Tuesday, JULIE-ANN DAVIES was arrested under the
         Official Secrets Act while attending her lectures at
         Kingston University. JA, as she's known online, is a
         popular correspondent with a lot of online types, including
         us (she's an active member of the Mark Thomas mailing list,
         which we played a part in starting). Obviously, we can't
         talk much about a current case, so allow us to take this
         opportunity to describe the same events should the
         arrest have occured after the Regulation of
         Investigatory Powers bill passes. The arrest of JA has
         generated a lot of uncomfortable publicity for the security
         services: a far better approach for them in the future, we'd
         suggest, would have been to skip the arrest, and serve an
         interception order on her instead. RIP allows interception
         warrants to be served on anyone who "has control of any part
         of the telecommunication system" which can definitely
         describe JA (and us, and you, for that matter). After that, they
         could compel her to pass on any communications she receives
         (it seems they were attempting to find out whether she'd
         been in e-mail contact with David Shayler, the ex-agent
         currently in exile in Paris). JA would, of course, not be
         allowed to reveal this to anyone, on pain of imprisonment.
         She'd be co-opted as a spook, and it would be a crime for
         her to disobey: even though the authorities were merely
         fishing for evidence. All hypothetical, of course: but we
         thought it's worth mentioning. While we can...

</span><span class="item">         The newsgroup uk.legal isn't a stranger to philosophical
         arguments over libel law, but it's not often someone decides
         to explore the practical effects. Last week, DAVID HOLLAND,
         in a argument over whether "truth" was a defence in a libel
         case decided to test the opinion - by posting potentially
         libellous (but, he claimed, true) opinions about one of his
         local dignatories. As if to prove the point, Demon stepped
         in, cancelled the message and cut off his posting rights
         until he'd signed an agreement not to post defamatory
         material again. This is a policy they'd introduced after the
         initial decision in the Lawrence Godfrey (see NTKs passim).
         A terrible infringement of free speech, agreed some posters,
         including DAVE BIRD, who promptly laid into Lawrence for
         introducing such a restriction. Unfortunately, Godfrey saw
         this post, and sent instructions to him too, demanding that
         the posting be removed. To be immediately followed, we hope,
         by postings decrying *this*, followed by more cancelling,
         and so on, and so on. We eagerly await the injunction to
         cancel the cancel messages themselves, until the courts
         finally decide who the hell's right around here.

</span><span class="item">         Ooh ooh! Free Net access from everybody! What could
         *possibly* be the catch? Well, since we're now bored of
         being gung-ho about the imminent Net revolution (see our
         slightly embarassing gushing over CallNet0800 earlier this
         year, and almost every newspaper this week), we're now
         collecting TANSTAAFLs on the next bound in Britain's leap
         into the Net swamp. So far, we've spotted that a) Altavista
         cut you off after five minutes of inactivity (which rather
         limits the "always on" feature that makes this such a good
         idea, b) NTL won't let you stay on for more than two hours
         (see (a)), and c) BT Net, in preparation for seeing their
         entire network fall over from the demand,  are now using
         private address spaces for their dial-ins, creating all
         kinds of freaky problems when you try and use non-Web
         services. Did we mention the complete lack of business plans
         for all of these until BT finally relents on holding the
         local loop? Or have we said that before?

         at London's LSE next Tuesday (we think). You can't check
         though, as the usual website has been "silenced" by a
         bizarre redesign, featuring imported Newshub headlines, a
         dumb scrolling applet and a Pong game.

         For those whose workside Net access is pinned underneath several
         protocol layers of firewall, proxy servers, filtering
         software and a large fierce dog owned by your bastard IT
         department, comes MAILTUNNEL, one of the more desperate
         protocol hacks you'll ever be tempted to use. In layman's terms,
         it's the equivalent to pricking out messages in blood
         with a broken thumbnail onto paper made from your own scalp
         sheddings, then throwing them between the bars of your
         Turkish prison in the hope that someone may find them sixty
         years on. More technically, it tunnels a two-way TCP/IP
         connection through, may Postel forgive us all, an exchange
         of e-mails. You may find it useful, if only as an indicator
         that it really is time you changed jobs. Or rose up against
         your sysadmin.

         best and longest running gags (Niles and Daphne) - or *does
         it*?... C5 continues chasing any niche market it can think of,
         with TRANNY NIGHT (from 8pm, Fri, C5) - apparently including a
         little-known cross-dressing Charles Bronson movie THE STONE
         KILLER (9pm, Fri, C5)... which segues gently into Sunday's
         QUEEN DAY (from 12.25pm, Sun, C5), with the always
         entertaining film of FLASH GORDON (5.05pm, Sun, C5) and
         hopefully plenty of opportunity to catch Freddie Mercury's
         bizarre speaking voice... replaced on "She's Gotta Have It" by
         Jayne Middlemiss, Arabella "Does my bum look big in this?"
         Weir continues parlaying that single punchline into an entire

         terrestrial showings in two and a half years for THE LAWNMOWER
         MAN (9pm, Tue, C5) seems like exactly two too many... plus
         another chance to savour Roger Ebert's "post-apocalyptic
         mechanical Darwinism" cliche in Kevin Costner's only semi-
         appalling WATERWORLD (9.30pm, Wed, BBC1), in which, he notes,

</span><span class="geekmedia">         THE "WHERE ARE THEY NOW?" FILE&gt;&gt; "I wonder if you remember
         an old magazine called 'Zero'," enquires NTK reader NICK
         SMITH, "- the essential read for Amiga/ST users in the late
         80's/early 90s?" Nick remembers the mag as being "really
         pretty funny", though confesses that he "was only 14 then so
         maybe it was shite", and goes on to wonder "where its
         writers are now, especially the cute one. Are they well
         known writers on current magazines, or do they live in
         bedsits in Pinner?" Nick concludes: "I do not live in a
         bedsit in Pinner"... So, over to the panel, and first up
         it's JONATHAN NASH: "Zero, from Dennis, was the
         16-bit-computer sister mag to console-based Game Zone, and
         featured the usual cast of writers. Dunc MacDonald was
         definitely there, and Patrick McCarthy (both now on PC Zone,
         except Dunc, who's vanished, although his sister turned up
         recently to say he wasn't dead or anything, but working on
         something excellent and secret), as well as Davey Wilson
         (now extremely high up in EA), Daniel Pemberton (who's gone
         on to be a big TV soundtrack composer, despite being about
         12), Jackie Ryan (went into PR), er, David McCandless (PC
         Zone again), er, er, Rich Pelley (works on Arcade), er, and
         possibly gentleman editor Jonathan Davies. And some other
         people"... hold it Jon - David McCandless? David
         "<a href="http://i.am/a.gaylord">http://i.am/a.gaylord</a>" McCandless? David, who just happens
         to be here with us tonight - anything you'd like to add? "In
         its 'non computery' section, Zero carried genuine interviews
         with Bungle of Rainbow, Norris McWhirter (who gave the
         interviewer Roy Castle's number in an attempt to end the
         interview and started a long running sketch series featuring
         his catchphrase: "String 'Em Up - it's the only language
         they understand"), Jeremy Beadle, and Bob Holness,"
         McCandless recalls, claiming they also "ran a section called
         'Smack In The Marf', where readers were invited to send
         pictures of injuries they had sustained in bar fights. I was
         17 at the time"... "Zero was the link for flappily
         purposeless readers between YOUR SINCLAIR and AMIGA POWER,
         and was indeed funny," Nash agrees, "except when it was
         'relaunched' towards the end as a horribly misjudged 'Young
         Lad' mag, complete with messy giveaway green slime, which
         got them in lots of trouble because it was made of lead or
         something, and they died within three issues. A tragic
         end"... thanks for that guys - but what about "the cute
         one"? "In the long tradition of games mags, quite a few of
         the female writers were made up, so this could be a crushing
         blow to Nick," Nash confides, though McCandless knows cute
         when he sees it: "The cute one, I believe, was Amaya Lopez,
         common law wife to David Wilson and expecting their
         first child in May." Well, there you go Nick - and if any
         other readers would like their teenage videogame-related
         crushes tracked down in possibly excessive detail, just
