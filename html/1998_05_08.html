</span><span class="item">         Free money! CLIFF STANFORD, ex-MD of Demon Internet,
         revealed his "secret future project" on Thursday, after
         selling up his share in Demon Internet for 33 million UKP
         (and, yes, the final price for the whole ISP was 66.6
         million, IN ACCORDANCE WITH PROPHECY). Voila REDBUS
         INVESTMENTS, a fund of 15 million UKP for innovative start-
         ups. Cliff, as the new Hermann Hauser, will be "drawing on
         his entrepreneurial and commercial experience" to make your
         dreams come true. Hopefully, this will include advice on
         choosing the right name: we note that as soon as Demon sold
         out, Cliff's old accountancy software company Data Command
         slapped ScotCom with a demand for a million pounds for
         misuse of the Demon name, which they still own. Of
         course, there's no way the tiny Data Command could afford
         to fight the case: unless, that is, some of the thwarted
         Demon bidders decided to lend a hand...

</span><span class="item">         Aspiring undergrads at the new Stanford University will be
         looking to Easynet old-boy KEITH TEARE for inspiration.
         His, ah, innovative idea of using plain words instead of
         URLs (see jokes passim) paid dividends when Altavista, of
         all people, snapped up the service. So it seems it *was* a
         clever idea, after all. And, while we're here, can we
         interest anyone in our idea to do a Java Web TV that lets
         you move around a VRML world using a VR headset and Pen
         Windows? Cliff?

         laptop, and a playdough-coloured vacuum cleaner. No, hold
         on: it's actually the iMac, an Internet-ready Apple machine
         that upholds all the values of the original Mac - ie, the
         screen's too small, there's not enough RAM, you can't get a
         printer to work with it, and it's too much money. Runs very
         fast, mind - though not as fast as Jobs will if it bombs.

         ONEDOTZERO2, running until 10/05/98 at the recently
         workstation-free Institute Of Contemporary Arts, London
         SW1. Expect the usual blurry nonsense masquerading as both
         art and/or entertaiment, although, promisingly, there are
         cinema showings of videogame FMV sequences - your chance to
         see Tekken characters as god intended them: the size of a
         house. Plus: pop videos, PlayStation Yaroze demos, and the
         obligatory outing for cyber-philosophising manga romp,
         Ghost In The Shell. The name ONEDOTZERO2 is the logic-
         defying sequel to last year's ONEDOTZERO, by the way, (ONE-
         DOT-ONE too tricky for them?); in the belief that this is
         how we computer people talk, the press release adds that

         proudly proclaims (p17) that "We actually said 90 per cent,
         but the producers didn't want to make the programme too
         frightening." Twats. Take your chance to commend Lynda La
         Plante on her sterling research when she chats live Tues
         lunchtime (12/05/98) on the C4 site. Oh, and bear in mind

         get for your no-hoper friends who keep on whining about how
         they'd like to get online but have more sense than money.
         Oh, and they've dropped all that annoying crippleware
         stuff, so it's vaguely (non-commercially) usable.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; yes, sci-fi fans, the BBC has rewarded your loyalty -
         with a *punishment gift*... first, LOST IN SPACE (7.15pm,
         Fri, BBC2) spins off from that show where X-Philes talked
         about their "obsession", this week mocking, er, we mean,
         celebrating avid viewers of Dr Who... then INVASION EARTH
         (9.30pm, Fri, BBC1) is the usual Sci-Fi Channel co-
         production CGI tosh - blah blah interdimensional conflict
         blah blah humanoid aliens blah blah SETI experts - but with
         RAF Tornados!... amazingly, still looking just like he did
         on The Young Ones, and amazingly, still going, it's ALEXEI
         SAYLE'S MERRY-GO-ROUND (9.30pm, Fri, BBC2)... filmed for
         peanuts, but after extensive re-mastering and marketing,
         doubtful whether indie low-budgeter EL MARIACHI (12.15am,
         Fri, BBC2) ever actually made any money... compulsory to
         make some sort of "nul points" joke about THE EUROVISION
         SONG CONTEST (8pm, Sat, BBC1) - though we prefer complex
         statisical analysis at <a href="http://www.kolumbus.fi/jarpen">http://www.kolumbus.fi/jarpen</a> ...
         otherwise, Mark and Lard's footy-bore FAN NIGHT (from 9pm,
         Sat, BBC2) doesn't seem to include Tom Cruise Vietnam
         wheelchair weepie BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY (11.15pm, Sat,
         BBC2)... and stick a vibrating pager down your pants to
         fully enjoy William Castle schlock classic THE TINGLER
         (12.30am, Sat, C5)... clearly not as much fun - or as easy
         to control - as the laserdisc arcade version, Clint
         Eastwood must "think in Russian" to pilot FIREFOX (3.05pm,
         Sun, some ITV regions)... and when Jeff Fahey creates a
         virtual girlfriend in confusingly-titled TV movie ADDICTED
         TO LOVE (9pm, Sun, C5), he clearly didn't learn anything
         from when he played The Lawnmower Man... the debut
         "Breakaway" episode enlivens the (normally superslow) Gerry
         Anderson Y2K panic-mongering SPACE: 1999 (6.25pm, Mon,
         BBC2)... then followed by what looks like a thinly
         disguised rerun of last year's appallingly named Carol
         Vorderman tech-literacy vehicle, COMPUTERS DON'T BITE
         (7.30pm, Mon, BBC2)... did they deliberately call that
         Robson Green serial-killer-chiller TOUCHING EVIL (9pm, Thu,
         ITV) because it sounds a bit like "Touching Cloth"?...
         plus: weariness, nausea, boredom with docus like HORIZON
         (9.30pm, Thu, BBC2) and their "chemical cocktail" theories
         - all symptoms of what experts are now calling "Gulf War
         Syndrome Syndrome"...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; due to some sort of administrative error, this week
         sees the release of a lot of home-grown/ foreign arty
         rubbish, instead of the usual blockbuster Hollywood
         rubbish. Fear not, normal service resumes next week...
         probably the worst "date movie" since The Company Of Men,
         yet Gary Glitter does not appear on the soundtrack to
         controversially dull kiddieporn LOLITA (imdb: romance /
         tragedy / sex-with-minor / drama / road / based-on-novel /
         paedophilia / love / obsession)... at last, a wacky Brit
         love story that looks like Friends for ugly people, with
         the rip-roaringly bland title of MARTHA, MEET FRANK, DANIEL
         AND LAURENCE (imdb: romance / comedy)... Rachel "Chain
         Reaction" Wiesz plays AMY FOSTER (MPAA rated: PG-13, for
         "elements of theme and some sensuality"), in Conrad-
         inspired craggy costume drama with unexpected gay
         undercurrents... it's a miraculous cancer recovery that's
         SOMETHING TO BELIEVE IN (imdb: soundtrack by Lalo "theme
         from Mission: Impossible" Schifrin)... like Deconstructing
         Harry beforehand, not too many surprises from real-life
         Woody Allen in for-fans-only jazz tour docu WILD MAN BLUES
         (<a href="http://www.virgin.net/cinema/filmfinder">www.virgin.net/cinema/filmfinder</a>: London only)... and it's
         a surprise Japanese Strictly-Ballroom-style hit that asks
         SHALL WE DANCE (Roger Ebert: "Ballroom dancing is regarded
         with great suspicion, in a country where couples don't go
         out hand in hand"). And it's - inevitably - hardly based at
         all on the song of the same name (off the soundtrack of The
         King And I, you dummies)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FEEDING&gt;&gt; KELLOGG's hit right back at the advance of
         instant cereal RUMBLERS [see NTK 06/03/98], with their own
         hastily bundled airline-style toilet-soundalike PORTA
         BOWLS, now available for Corn Flakes, Frosties etc.
         Slightly cheaper than Rumblers (but still about 80p), they
         include milk, sugar, and a napkin, but are ultimately let
         down by bland post-war design and a much less interesting
         spoon... sticking with cereals, do HEALTHWISE BRAN FLAKES
         actually taste worse than Bran Flakes Classic?... oh, and
         by the way, NTK still advocates punching the side out of
         variety pack boxes and pouring the milk in there... reader
         ADRIAN MOULDER contests our nomination of SPOONERS as last
         month's "taste abomination" [see NTK 24/04/98], claiming
         that fruity "vitamin B1&amp;6-C enriched beverage" SUNNY
         DELIGHT "tastes so foul that it must be good for you -
         especially the strawberry one, which is disgusting"... but
         NTK regular CHARLIE BROOKER reckons he can beat it with
         SPRITZER's ZERO GRAVITY clear-can drinks, with "lots of
         little gelatine *balls* floating around inside". "It's
         disconcerting!" Charlie adds. "You have to drink the
         balls!" Sounds like the UK arrival of freaky US staple,
         ORBITZ [see NTK 13/06/97]?... bev-flash: ubiquitous US
         chain STARBUCKS to acquire growing UK presence THE SEATTLE
         COFFEE COMPANY... also headed here soon? - the ROBERT CRUMB
         DEVIL GIRL CHOCO-BAR ("It's *bad* for you!")... finally, we
         don't know what it is that McVITIE's are putting in their
         "crispy cracker snack" tubs CRACK POTS (various flavours,
         inc garlic &amp; herb), but it makes them almost as addictive
         as their freebase cocaine namesake... still, they'll need
         something strong to take on the mini-Pringle stacks; like
         they say, "Once you've popped, you just can't stop" - a
         slogan (we believe) appropriated from sellers of amyl
         nitrate...
