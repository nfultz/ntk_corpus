</span><span class="item">         The SEGA/BANDAI merger was called off just hours before the
         first official document was due to be signed on Wednesday.
         The combination of Sega's video game experience with
         Bandai's high tech toys (Power Rangers, Tamagotchi et al)
         could have created a Japanese Disney beater, but apparently
         Bandai workers feared a corporate culture clash between
         their relaxed, informal working style and Sega's stricter
         management practices. Nothing to do, then, with the poor
         performance of the Bandai-manufactured Apple net-box
         Pippin, or the Sega Saturn (last seen in Selfridges at a
         bargain-basement UKP99...) Bandai president Makoto
         Yamashina says he takes full responsibility for the flopped
         deal, and will now resign. And they're the informal,
         relaxed ones, remember?

</span><span class="item">         The National Criminal Intelligence Service's PROJECT
         TRAWLER looks to be recommending new Net monitoring powers
         for the police. Detective Super BRIAN DREW of the NCIS
         announced "Interception of Internet communications is very
         difficult", and clearly hoped a few new laws might simplify
         the process.  Meanwhile NCIS Director General Albert Pacey
         reported that "In the UK, we're finding criminals moving
         from drugs importation to software piracy". Drugs barons
         can't afford Office either?

         hated competitors to AT&amp;T's US-based "World"Net. Customers
         will be shipped off in mid-June; e-mail will be forwarded

         CD-ROMs, Wakefield-based UK games house TEAM 17 has axed
         its multimedia division, formerly known as The Big Room,
         with the loss of seven jobs. Over the last two years, the
         department had completed just one title - an introduction
         to the Internet called Access All Areas. The company now
         hopes to spend more time with its core business of writing
         PC games, like its reworking of that old tanks-on-mountains
         classic, Worms.

         packages is to be tested in court. COMPUTING reports that
         GEOFFREY DARNDON, a management consultant, is to sue SAGE
         after their software wasted nine months of his work
         (allegedly). 'Opening the envelope meant I had agreed to a
         licence that states Sage is not responsible for anything,'
         said Darndon. He's fighting that declaration in Portsmouth
         Court next month. We asked Sage for an e-mail comment, but
         we're too scared to read past the headers.

         As-you'd-expect non-sequitur stand-up from HARRY HILL
         (10.35pm, Fri, C4) tonight, but otherwise it's a week of
         movies, movies, movies, starting off with C4 showing
         (entirely uncut) that little-known cult heist flick
         RESERVOIR DOGS (10.30pm, Sat, C4) - and the really good
         news is that it finishes just in time to turn over for the
         last episode of SPACE: ABOVE AND BEYOND (12.40am, Sat,
         BBC2)... amazingly, there appears to be yet another series
         of THE OUTER LIMITS (8.55pm, Sun, BBC2), this week ripping
         off Independence Day... the sci-fi theme continues with Jim
         Rockford X-File FIRE IN THE SKY (10.40pm, Mon, BBC1) -a
         fairly recent alien-abduction drama apparently "based on
         fact"... pigs are more intelligent than chimpanzees (or at
         least better than them at playing video games) claims QED
         (10pm, Tue, BBC1)... scheduling tragedy of the month is the
         highly rated SAY ANYTHING (1.15am, Tue night/Wed morning,
         ITV) - John Cusack, Ione Skye in cute-with-an-edge teen
         romance from Cameron "Jerry Maguire" Crowe... a promising-
         sounding investigation into people's perception of health
         risks forms the basis of new series ANXIETY ATTACK (7.30pm,
         Wed, BBC2), while ER (10pm, Wed, C4) concludes its run with
         a totally undramatic non-cliffhanger ending - yeah,
         right...
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         MOVIES: By all accounts, TURBULENCE (Ray Liotta, Lauren
         Holly) is rubbish: you'd do much better to try and catch
         one of the "special weekend previews" of next week's
         similarly themed aerial disaster blaster CON AIR (Nicolas
         Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich)... otherwise it's a
         bizarre choice between wacky presidential murder thriller
         ABSOLUTE POWER (Clint Eastwood, Gene Hackman, Ed Harris),
         or food-related feel-gooders like BIG NIGHT and THE
         SPITFIRE GRILL...
</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         CHOC: More limited edition mutants from the Sweetshop of
         Doctor Moreau: Cadbury's continue to abuse the power of
         mint with their MINT CRUNCHIE, but then outdo themselves,
         we think, with the WISPACCINO, a Wispa despoiled with a
         cappuccino flavoured caramel. Big news though, is that
         NESTLE ROWNTREE are fighting back with a BLUE KIT KAT next
         month. Sadly, it's just the wrapper that goes blue when
         it's put into the fridge. But still: you know - cool.
