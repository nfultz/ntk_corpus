</span><span class="item">         One week into his Net adventures, and it's still unclear
         what kind of newbie TONY BLAIR is going to be. At the launch
         of the government's new e-commerce push, he tapped
         mournfully on a PC with just his index finger, spoke of his
         "sense of humiliation" while watching Cherie use the Web
         ("who are you talking to, darling?"), and promised the
         nation he'd take a course. But then, just like a newbie, he
         immediately started lecturing everyone on how it all should
         work. Also rather typically, he seems to be trying a
         *little* too hard to impress the old guard - especially with
         his choice of the new "E-Envoy", Alex Allan -  ex-high
         commissioner of Australia, ex-Demon user, and continuing
         Deadhead. Very 1995 - but is he really one of us? Well, if
         he isn't already, we reckon few blackmail notes regarding
         the flagrant lyrics copyright violations on his Website
         could "turn him", easy. Yeah, he's our warez king E-Envoy,
         baby - and it freaks us out!

</span><span class="item">         Meanwhile, in the good old Elite universe, it looks like the
         trading between the systems of BELL (Anarchist, some trade
         in medicinal plants) and BRABEN (Feudal Capitalist, major
         export: buggy releases of Elite sequels) has broken down
         completely. At the alt.fan.elite HQ, just outside Lave,
         co-creator David Braben has denied that he idly shot down
         Ian Bell's CIX Web site when he thought no-one was looking.
         On the contrary, he says, he was on a special mission to
         *help* Bell by inquiring whether Bell still held his half of
         Elite's copyright. He innocently asked Cix whether Bell
         really did have the legal right to offer binaries of the
         old game on his site, and - booom - suddenly the ISP was
         sending in the Vipers. Nothing to do with him, honest. So
         why didn't Braben contact Bell directly, instead of via Cix?
         Braben reports that Bell could not be reached - he doesn't
         reply to e-mail hails, apparently, and is currently living
         in some sort of unnavigable Witchspace where normal contact
         is impossible. Odd, given that it took us less than two
         minutes (via Cix's own "show resume" feature) to get Ian's
         phone number and ask him ourselves. Nope, Bell said, Braben
         had never e-mailed him about this. And no, as far as he
         knew, no personal approaches have ever been made. The first
         he knew about the matter was when "incoming legal missile"
         sirens started wailing. So, who's the fugitive, and who's the
         honest trader? Or have they - as it seems to the wailing
         Elite fanboys - all been replaced by Thargoid agents?

         COME *ON*, Lynx people! You were going to have to try
         another browser EVENTUALLY. Quit bawling.

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt; OK, so it's Chris "Aphex Twin, Neuromancer" Cunningham
         on MIRRORBALL (12.40am, Fri, C4) *this* week... one of
         Whoopi Goldberg's less irritating IRC action romances in
         JUMPIN' JACK FLASH (11.05pm, Fri, BBC1) - followed by the
         intriguingly renamed spag-bollocks Western A TOWN CALLED
         HELL (aka "A Town Called Bastard")... while, sadly, C5's
         late-night 1958 movie AUNTIE MAME (2.10am, Fri, C5) is not
         about the various "offspring" of the Multiple Arcade Machine
         Emulator... "You want the shouting? YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE
         SHOUTING!" implies Jack Nicholson of Tom Cruise in mildly
         unpleasant military courtroomer A FEW GOOD MEN (10.10pm,
         Sat, ITV)... launching a brief season of cult Saturday night
         dress-up-in-a-trenchcoat-and-gun-down-your-classmates films,
         Leo DiCaprio shoots more than just hoops and heroin in THE
         BASKETBALL DIARIES (10pm, Sat, C4)... and those lamers from
         Trainspotting could have tried to make A LIFE LESS ORDINARY
         (10pm, Sun, C4) a bit more watchable - at least compared to
         the unauthorised biography of webdesign playboy Matt Jones,
         as depicted in Greg Egan fave YOUNG EINSTEIN (5.50pm, Sun,
         C5)... oddly, two separate docus on "birth order" on
         consecutive days: EQUINOX (9pm, Mon, C4) and the
         defensively-titled ME FIRST (9pm, Tue, BBC2)... don't know
         what kind of trade descriptions made them take the "Comedy"
         out of THE MARK THOMAS PRODUCT (11.05pm, Tue, C4)... and Sky
         subscribers will already be setting aside midweek quality
         time for not just the UK debut of FUTURAMA (8pm, Tue, Sky1),
         but also series 3 of STARGATE SG-1 (8pm, Wed, Sky1) *and*
         short-lived movie spinoff TOTAL RECALL 2070 (9pm, Wed,
         Sky1), in which presumably the lead character goes on a
         different memory- wiping adventure each week, but every time
         it all turns out to be - a dream!...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; presumably it's the backs of Kirsten Dunst, Kirstie
         Alley and Denise "Starship Troopers" Richards on the poster
         for erratic bad-taste beauty-pageant mockumentary DROP DEAD
         GORGEOUS (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a>: vulgar
         gesture; teen underwear; long series of camera angle to
         focus viewer on private regions of teen females; strong
         thread of likening "Christian" to guns; many subtle and
         disguised comments regarding superficial and off-target
         love for the Savior). It does include the monologue from
         Soylent Green, yet does not appear to be based around the
         Republica song of the same name... still, probably more
         (intentional) laughs than distasteful Travolta army
         thriller THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER (imdb: rape / military) -
         repeated shots of naked corpse staked to ground may
         "attract wrong element"... or Anthony Hopkins going native/
         to jail in Cuba Gooding derivative monkey weepie INSTINCT
         (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a>: prison ugliness;
         violent beatings to escape lawful custody; nudity of a
         third-world child; party drinking ; muffled words of foul
         language; dog threat)... otherwise there's the usual
         limited release arthouse efforts: non Star Wars spinoff THE
         TRENCH (imdb: English), Charlotte "Marmalade Atkins"
         Coleman politico-romance BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE (imdb: comedy),
         plus Van Damme redux in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER: THE RETURN
         (<a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/</a>: human form on fire;
         punk music and dress; changing clothes in a car; nude bar
         brawl scene with multiple full nudity; murder by gunfire to
         head and body; murder by strangulation; murder by
         electrocution; murder by explosion; murder by fire; murder
         by neck break). Apparently, not as good as the first one...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         BUMPER BONERZ BONANZA&gt;&gt; thanks to everyone who realised that
         we meant *Simon* Singh's THE CODE BOOK [NTK 1999-09-10]
         rather than "David Singh's THE CODE", though only regular
         steampunk correspondent, TOM STANDAGE (ESQ.), appeared to
         have actually read it, commenting "very good - even if it
         does get Babbage's Analytical Engine and Difference Engine
         No.2 in a twist"... in that same paragraph, we also gave
         the date of Birkbeck lecture "Renaissance Cryptography and
         Johannes Trithemius" as 6pm, 1999-09-10 - as keen-eyed
         ROGER BURTON WEST pointed out, allowing readers a "generous
         43 minutes to get there". In fact it's on at 6pm today; the
         clock is ticking... NIAMH FOLEY objected mildly to our
         "WANKOMETER needs upgrading for these guys" comment re
         <a href="http://www.labyrinth.ie/approach.asp">http://www.labyrinth.ie/approach.asp</a> [NTK 1999-09-10],
         revealing that she was a) a "gal", and b) on a "coffee
         high" when she wrote it... SCRIPT_KIDDY makes a rather more
         urgent observation, requesting "Please append ::$DATA to
         all URLs you publish ending in .asp", believing that we
         have some sort of knack for "for picking just the
         vulnerable ones" - <a href="http://www.labyrinth.ie/login.asp">http://www.labyrinth.ie/login.asp</a>::$DATA
         , say. If you, the readers, agree, then why not start a
         petition on your website (or someone else's)?... EMAP's
         ROGER GREEN (rightly) questioned what evidence we had
         linking EMAP to Freenetnames owner ITG [NTK 1999-09-03] -
         will <a href="http://www.itg.co.uk/new/emapmetro.htm">http://www.itg.co.uk/new/emapmetro.htm</a> do?... and
         finally, JOHN HARTNUP argues that "only the chorus" of
         S Club 7's new single sounds like The Spice Girls' "Say
         You'll Be There", advising that "The verse sounds like
         'Check It Out' by the Stereo MCs". ANTONY ESPINDOLA went on
         to list 3 more points of similarity between the bands:
         they've got the same manager (Simon Fuller); the video's
         the same; and they're "doing a film" which "[quote] 'will
         be about us as a gang and what we get up to'". NTK regrets
         that this correspondence is now closed...
