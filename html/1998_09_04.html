         hoping Carnegie-Mellon will turn their sociological
         microscopes to a rash of Net-related amnesia that's been
         doing the rounds. Sources close to the BILL GATES court
         deposition indicate that The World's Cleverest Man has great
         problems recalling the exact chain of events that lead to
         company writing its browser - and indeed, many Microsoft
         representatives apparently found it different to even remember
         the term. "Witnesses claim they don't know what a browser is.
         What used to be browsers are now simply 'bits of browsing
         technologies.'" reports the NYT's Joel Brinkley, though of
         course this was all in the pre-Outlook days, an era of
         almost medieval chaos...

</span><span class="item">         Australasia seems to be heading for a Mad Max period of
         lawlessness. Australia's LABOR PARTY has fired two workers,
         following a Web crack of the opposing Liberal party's
         Website (which linked the site to hardcore porn, and called
         John Howard the "Prime Minister for Pain, Suffering and
         Inequity". Satire!). Thank God New Zealander PETER GUTMANN
         still has some respect for law and order. Wanting to
         demonstrate his cryptlib software on a US trip, he wrote for
         - and received, a temporary permit for its dangerous crypto
         wares. The principle proviso was that he came back with the
         disk. Naturally, to comply with US export laws, the disk he
         returned with had to be re-formatted before leaving the US.
         That was okay, though, because the code on the disk was
         readily available from European ftp sites anyway. Naturally,
         Peter complied with all existing legislation during his
         trip, including a document that allowed him to export a disk
         to Auckland, then re-import it back to the same spot. As
         Peter says, "It's folk wisdom that dealing with bureaucrats
         is like running around in circles, but I may be one of the
         few people on earth to have an official government permit to
         do this."

</span><span class="item">         There's no news around for our third item, so instead we'll
         keep you informed on how all the other Net journalists are
         coping with the famine. MICHAEL WOLFF, who
         famously wrote a book on his own experiences as a Net
         publisher in "Burn Rate", devotes his New York Times
         Magazine column to how he's being written about
         by Brill's Content, a mag entirely devoted to analyses of
         other journalists. Noah Robischon, the Net journalist
         commissioned to do the Brill piece, is ex-editor of Netly
         News, the Net publisher of which, Josh Quittner, wrote the
         definitive Net-journalist-on-other-Net-Journalists piece,
         the story of Suck in Wired. Suck's Carl Steadman, the only
         man we believe qualified (by talent and academic training)
         to indulge in this kind of postmodernism, has been subtly
         demolishing Michael Wolff in his Industry Standard columns
         (a magazine that Michael Wolff himself writes a column for).
         Carl's also been encouraging Gary Wolf to write *his* story
         of everybody else's stories in his upcoming history of
         Wired. Hopefully, the Wired book will include a chapter on
         the executive editor of HotWired, Gary Wolf, and thus an
         infinite regress.

         more populist tone (presumably to attract young people to
         the field) with its TOYS FOR THE BOYS theme, and promises of
         "gadgets, cars, and girls!". Oops, no, sorry, got the press
         releases muddled up: the BAAS fest examines "The Challenge
         For Science" under the calm gaze of controversial
         neuroscientist Prof Colin Blakemore, while the appalling
         sounding "Toys For The Boys" show is run by "Crucial Events
         Ltd" at the Wembley Exhibition and Conference Centre,
         04-06/09/98. Please note that the "gadgets" include very few
         useful household devices, like washing machines, food
         processors or irons, and that - disappointingly - the show
         features no actual children's toys.

         sleeping coastguards this week. It's just the Mac and
         Windows users who get to revel in embedded photo-IDs in
         their key certifs, secure server access and better
         revocation features (like giving trusted friends revocation
         capabilities and keys that expire). Bitter UNIXen should
         stick to GnuPG, although last we heard, the guy working on
         the UNIX ports had left Network Associates (after death
         threats regarding his junking of the old command line, no
         doubt), and so they're a tad undermanned in that department.
         Zimmerman may be a DOS-boy at heart, but he's paid his dues
         by now.

         returning "Comedy" Zone - the "University Challenge" episode
         of THE YOUNG ONES (10pm, Fri, BBC2)... fear not: "Mr Hankey
         The Christmas Poo" is widely regarded as one of the best
         SOUTH PARKs ever (11.05pm, Fr, C4)... while Hywel Bennett's
         PERCY (12.35pm, Fri, BBC1) may be *the worst sex comedy of
         all time* (unless there's another Bennett vehicle called
         "Bysshe")... Astra-owning MiSTies rejoice, as MST3k
         reschedules to avoid the Sky watershed with Gemini Man
         nonsense "Riding with Death" (10pm, Fri, SciFi)...
         fortunately, the "new season" starts on Sat, with ITV
         fielding GLADIATORS (6pm), Cilla Black's alt.games-style
         MOMENT OF TRUTH (7pm), plus - wait for it - MOTORWAY LIFE
         (8.30pm), a fly-on-the-wall docu about people who work on
         (or near) the M6... the competition: Costner's costly
         not-too-bad (but bad) WATERWORLD (9pm, Sat, BBC1), one of
         those rare films where the studio logo merges seamlessly
         into the opening scene... still, a bit more action than
         Crichton's emotionless (but widescreen) repeat, WESTWORLD
         (10.45pm, Sun, BBC2)... most promising phrases used by Radio
         Times to describe Di doc THE PRINCESS'S PEOPLE (9.30pm, Sun,
         BBC2): "unsentimental" and "those who appeared to be
         indifferent"... if there was any justice, viewers of Gus Van
         Sant's dire EVEN COWGIRLS GET THE BLUES (12.35am, Sun, C4)
         could go to him and demand two hours of their lives
         *back*... new cop drama LIVERPOOL ONE (9pm, Mon, ITV)
         ingeniously pits Brookie's Barry Grant against hot new
         psychologist, Samantha Janus!... when will they pay tribute
         to whoever invented mad cycling science demo show LOCAL
         HEROES (8pm, Mon, BBC2)?...  plus: surprise! ITV buries new,
         actually OK-ish Kirstie "Lieutenant Saavik" Alley sitcom
         VERONICA'S CLOSET (10.40pm, Mon, ITV)... EQUINOX (9pm, Tue,

         review/ preview slot THE HAUNTED FISHTANK (12.40am, Tue,
         some ITV) - presented by Ed Hall, possibly the new, ginger
         Johnny Vaughan... flee from BATMAN FOREVER (8.30pm, Wed,
         ITV), and - there is no god - *another* series of incoherent
         musos "chatting" with JO WHILEY (11.25pm, Wed, C4)...
         HORIZON samples Viagra (9pm, Thu, BBC2)... though
         alternative "cures" include those offered by Nick Broomfield
         in FETISHES (11pm, Thu, C4)... coverage of the 50th
         Farnborough on THE AIR SHOW (8pm, Thu, BBC2)... and of

         there's no-one pointing guns at them while they're pointing

         harder: Anna Friel and god-awful Rachel Weisz in THE LAND
         GIRLS (imdb: drama / wwii / period / rural / women / dorset

         Wilkinson Sword also chose this month to launch their
         clashing blade, PROTECTOR 3D METAL, promising "technology in

         with shampoo (<a href="http://www.alberto.com/vo5hdtip.htm">http://www.alberto.com/vo5hdtip.htm</a>) - yet

         ads for Elida Faberge's hip new FUSION fragrance for
         incorporating white powder samples plus the tagline "The
         only thing in a club worth sniffing"... also from Connected

         CAMERON-CLARKE highlighted alarming claims from ESTEE LAUDER
         that their latest skin toner "actually re-programs" the skin
         to produce less oil...  but READER MILLINGTON wins the NTK
         geek makeover prize with his observation that BOOTS' SPA
         TONING lotion asserts that "after one application", it
         increases the skin's elasticity "by at least 19 per cent".
         His girlfriend has "been applying it all week, so I should
         be able to pull her ears right the way down onto her chin
         then watch them spring up again"...
