         to putting a bunch of Wilhelm Reich fans inside an Orgone
         machine : what transpired may not change many minds, but
         *boy* it sounded like they were having fun in there. The
         tribes building the new Net got to see each other through
         the impending nanotech mist, briefly: the wiring techmonkeys
         of WiFi (winners of Best T-Shirt Motto By A Mile: "CRIMINAL.
         ANARCHIST. PARASITES."), the keyboard rattling hoardes of
         Blogistan, the Men-In-Suits-With-Earrings of the Web
         Services crowd, and the grubby-but-unbowed street P2Punks of
         last year's file-sharing implosion. You know when the geek
         mood is up when attendees stop talking about making rent
         this month, and resume predicting the date of the
         Singularity. Looks like we're back to looking up at a
         J-curve - and after all those months of sitting on a U-bend, too.

</span><span class="item">         Last week's plea for "anyone who does interesting weird-tech
         things" elicited some interesting responses, not least those
         of GEORGE AND FREEMAN DYSON, who confirmed that they'll be
         dropping by EXTREME COMPUTING (Sunday 2002-06-09, the Camden
         Centre, London, blah blah blah) to discuss George's new book
         revealing his dad's work on spacecraft powered by nuclear
         explosions (the quantum electrodynamics pioneer is of course
         also the father of former ICANN chairwoman Esther, and the
         inventor of the Dyson sphere, as seen in the "Relics" episode
         of Star Trek: The Next Generation). Joining them on this -
         increasingly startling - bill is TOM "The Mechanical Turk"
         STANDAGE, a selection of some of the UK's top satire sites,
         and ZDNet-UK's RUPERT GOODWINS, who'll be hosting a salute to
         20 Years Of The ZX Spectrum, introduced by former 1980s pop
         icon, GARY LE STRANGE. You know, we couldn't make this up.

         anyway. It's corporate nostalgia masquerading as some sort of
         cultural significance, and who gets the biggest single display
         - Tomb Raider? Nintendo? No, RockStar Games, of course, a
         company co-founded by exhibition curator Lucien King. Somehow,
         we had a feeling we were going to be disappointed by GAME ON:
         THE HISTORY, CULTURE AND FUTURE OF GLOBAL GAMING (The
         Barbican, London EC2Y, until 2002-09-15, UKP11 full price,
         UKP5-8 concessions). And yeah, there's a PDP-1, and some coin-
         ops on free play (until they get broken), and the basic 8-bit
         machines you'd expect (perched on top of PC emulators), but 11
         quid to get in? You can spend an hour in a real arcade - or
         buy your own retro console - for that.

         pop favourites, a backwards-looking lineup which goes from
         "19" by Paul Hardcastle to "Where's Your Head At?" by Basement
         Jaxx. And he's "doing" the ARTHUR C CLARKE awards again on Sat
         (from 1.30pm, The Wellcome Wing, The Science Museum, London),

</span><span class="item">         Mark this one down as sufficiently retarded tech. As an
         exercise in caffeine abuse and hubris, NTK's own PANOPTICON
         is a graphical stalking system for finding bloggers and
         other celebs in the corridors of the ETCON conference. Now
         that the conference is over, we thought you'd like to survey
         the damage, and perhaps gut it for your own purposes.
         Redeeming features: it does live updating on a Webpage
         without a page reload in sight. It does Web Services the
         old-fashioned way, with a http GET sending data, and a
         telnet stream outputting streaming updates. You can put rude
         words on it and click on things. Warning: it's javascript,
         and therefore shit. It'll only work on Windows IE 5+ and
         Mozilla/Gecko browsers. It scares Opera so much you'll never
         escape. And my in-depth knowledge of NTK clickthrough rates
         and how badly I wrote the server says that it'll crash and
         burn as soon as we send this out. We'll fix it in time for
         XCOM, I don't think.

         DAY (10.30pm, Sat, ITV) - last shown on terrestrial TV in May
         2000 - isn't this week's only case of deja vu: there's "Men In
         Black" knockoff THE SILENCERS (9pm, Fri, C5) - last shown
         August 1999; Christopher "Spinal Tap" Guest's dud remake of
         ATTACK OF THE 50FT WOMAN (1.05am, Fri, BBC1) - last shown Aug
         2000; and, more entertainingly, a teenage Eliza "Faith" Dushku
         as Arnie's tearaway daughter in TRUE LIES (10.30pm, Sat, BBC1) -
         last shown March 2000... plus a DIY introduction to America's
         tenuous grasp of libel in THE PEOPLE VS LARRY FLYNT (1.05am,
         Sat, C4) - last shown October 2000; and frankly disappointing
         Gibson adaptation JOHNNY MNEMONIC (9pm, Sun, C5) - last shown
         Aug 2001 on BBC1. Phew... in terms of new stuff, Jeff Bridges
         suspects wacky neighbour Tim Robbins of being a mad terrorist
         bomber in slightly-more-topical-than-when-it-was-made paranoia
         thriller ARLINGTON ROAD (10pm, Sun, C4)... C4's factual
         department dumps a bunch of zany high-concept documentaries
         before its schedules go all Big Brother, in the form of the
         top 100 poorly differentiated GREATEST WORLD CUP MOMENTS (9pm,
         Sat, C4), SAS tell-all debunk TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH: THE
         REAL BRAVO TWO ZERO (9pm, Mon, C4), the self-explanatory
         DANIELLA WESTBROOK: MY NOSE AND ME (10pm, Wed, C4), and
         inspirationally titled old-people workplace docu-soap WORKING
         WITH DINOSAURS (8pm, Tue, C4)... then it's back to the
         temporal anomalies again, with Van Damme "Terminator" knockoff
         TIMECOP (10.35pm, Wed, BBC1) - last shown Sep 2000... plus
         Arnie flaunting those one-piece sunglasses that have indeed
         become surprisingly fashionable in the 21st century, as the
         original THE TERMINATOR (9pm, Tue, C5) - last shown on ITV
         about two months ago...

         possible advantage would there be to having a 'clone army' in
         a technologically advanced universe with no apparent shortage
         of available manpower?" - comes even more interminable blue-

         One [outfit] shows [Portman's] bare back and shoulders,

         later is ripped at the bottom to reveal her bare midriff)...
         or, apparently assuming that anyone who doesn't want to go
         see Star Wars must be either French or gay, the only other
