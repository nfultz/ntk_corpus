</span><span class="item">         It's not often you catch Slashdot, Kuro5hin, Newsnight and
         BBC's Question Time covering the same story. And while we
         still await the day Jeremy Paxman screams "MOD THE PARENT
         UP!" at a ashen-faced spokesman, one topic bound them all
         this week: the insane new RIP STATUTORY INSTRUMENT. This
         piece of pseudo-legislation, which the government clearly
         hoped to sneak past parliament next Tuesday, extends the
         list of authorities able tap everyone's traffic data without
         a warrant. In the original RIP bill, only coppers, customs
         and the secret services could obtain phone numbers, Web
         addresses, and cellphone positions willy-nilly. With the new
         instrument, anyone from a local councillor to the Office of
         Fair Trading, down to the Post Office^W^WConsignia^Wthe
         Royal Mail can stalk you without judicial oversight. Over
         twenty new government departments are listed, with no
         explanation or justification (the Department of Work and
         Pensions is fighting terrorism how exactly?). It really is a
         "shopping" list in every sense but the car-jacking one. As
         with so much of the original RIP bill, *nobody* thinks this
         is a good idea. Councillors we've spoken with are worried
         about the abuse potential, other departments are freaking
         out at the cost of overseeing the new powers. Already the
         hundreds of faxes sent to MPs and messages to the news media
         have secured one concession: our gracious leaders have
         postponed the debate until next Monday, 2002-06-24. If we
         keep the pressure up, they may be obliged to withdraw it
         completely. Check out STAND for more info on what the Blunt
         Instrument means, and what to do about it.

</span><span class="item">         Don't expect to see those Radio Four Ogg streams for much
         longer. News arrives that the oldest and most deeply Unixy
         wing of the BBC, the bunnies at Kingswood Warren, have been
         summarily merged with Streaming Media Services, some
         quasi-commercial bit of Intel tat the Beeb bought back in
         the day. SMS is a Windows shop and does such cutting-edge
         work as providing KPMG with videofeeds, and signing
         "significant" content deals with 3G companies. You get the
         idea. Kingswood, for all its paranoia and somewhat BOFHish
         reputation, does things like set up public peering
         arrangements (and publishes the statistics for everyone to
         see), experiments with aforementioned patent-free Ogg Vorbis
         technology (can't see the Windows Media fans at SMS going
         for that), and otherwise handles the deep research that the
         BBC needs in these winnowing times. With heavy muttering
         coming from the beards about a lousy relocation package and
         a prospective two hour commute to Maidenhead, is this the
         Beeb's deliberate attempt to ditch anyone with a clue?

</span><span class="item">         We had a couple of excuses lined up in case the weekend's
         EXTREME COMPUTING festival didn't come off - that it was
         inherently experimental, that we didn't know how many people
         were going to turn up, that no-one else had ever tried to
         combine semi-scientific seminars with the ambience of a
         Scandinavian demo party. Of course, the one thing we weren't
         prepared for was it turning out to be so much of a success -
         we won't single anyone out for particular thanks, because
         everyone did such a great job, making it the best fifth
         birthday party any sarcastic technology newsletter could ask
         for. Sure, it wasn't perfect - apologies to the ZX Spectrum
         panel for making them beta-test the PA system, and a few signs
         here and there wouldn't have gone amiss either. But there were
         almost 1200 visitors during the course of the day, the
         feedback has been almost embarrassingly positive, and we'll
         definitely do something similar again next year. It only
         remains to say: would the owners of the POP logins "steve",
         "e.tedeschi", and "olly" please change their email passwords?
         They showed up unencrypted in the wireless network traffic
         logs and - if you hadn't noticed - we're trying to campaign
         quite hard against this kind of thing.

         the guy who said it was "full of people getting far too much

         2002-06-21, Gossips Nightclub, London W1, UKP5.00, pre-

         rock concert outside of Japan", it features performances from
         demo musicians, C64 remixers and live bands, plus Jon "Sensi
         Soccer" Hare, Bjorn "Dr Awesome" Lynne, and Jeff "Llamasoft"
         Minter. And hints of an appearance by Emily "Bouff" Booth,

</span><span class="item">         If Perl is the Swiss Army chainsaw of programming languages,
         then SOCAT is the Swiss Army chainsaw of, uh,
         shell/networking tools. Socat works by connecting the input
         and output of two files together - where file can be a
         socket, or a pipe, or any number of other filish mutants
         that Unix has spawned. Need to connect to your SMTP server
         to do some manual diagnostics, a la netcat or telnet? Sure.
         Feel like wrapping readline around that to get command
         history? No problem. You can connect an IPV6 address to a
         chrooted shell script, run ssh with its controlling tty
         connected to stdin so it'll accept the password from
         something other than the keyboard, or attach a Unix socket
         to an inet socket. You can tunnel a local Unix socket
         through someone's socks server to an unprotected internal X
         server, using a source port of 20 to slip by a
         poorly-configured firewall. And that's just the manpage
         examples! It's available as a Debian unstable package and
         FreeBSD port, and v1.2 (due this month) has a pile of extra
         goodies to anticipate, including fake pseudo terminals, and
         ssl support. I can't believe I just wrote "fake pseudo
         terminals".

</span><span class="geekmedia">         TV&gt;&gt;&gt; Dolph Lundgren Week gets off to a flying start in his
         long-awaited collaboration with Russell "Highlander" Mulcahy
         and Gina "Coupling" Bellman: flashy sniper thriller SILENT
         TRIGGER (11.20pm, Fri, BBC1)... then he's back in C5's annual
         showing of UNIVERSAL SOLDIER (9pm, Sun, C5), but not UNIVERSAL
         SOLDIER: THE RETURN (9pm, Tue, C5)... Susan "The Partridge
         Family" Dey scans her ass into a computer in overlooked
         Michael Crichton 1980s synthespian romp LOOKER (2.40am, Fri,
         C5)... and there's more stuff the DVD director's commentary
         doesn't tell you when THE HOLLYWOOD MACHINE (8.20pm, Sat,
         BBC2) takes a long, hard look at "Charlie's Angels"... Vince
         "Swingers" Vaughn puts the "master" back into "Norman Bates"
         in unnecessary remake PSYCHO (9.10pm, Sat, BBC1)... Sam
         "Spider-Man" Raimi redoes "Fargo", but from the criminals'
         point of view in A SIMPLE PLAN (10.35pm, Sat, BBC2)... and
         Jonathan Ross once again maintains he's laughing *with* - not
         at - the wacky foreign culture in JAPANORAMA (11pm, Sat; 10pm,
         Sun, BBC Choice)... BITTER HARVEST (8pm, Sun, BBC2) sounds
         like a promisingly non-partisan look at the history of GM
         food... Robin Wright Penn falls for Kevin Costner in overlong
         nautical-metaphor closure-weepie MESSAGE IN A BOTTLE (9pm,
         Mon, C5) - as we said back in 1999, not based around the
         Police song of the same name, though the soundtrack does
         occasionally break into the opening line of Queen's "We Are
         The Champions"... and Mike Myers presents another of his
         famously understated characterisations in 1970s Neve Campbell
         nightclub nonsense 54 (12.15am, Mon, C4)... C4 takes a timely
         look at the relevance of reality TV in what is basically a
         rebranded "Right To Reply", THINK TV (7.55pm, Tue-Thu, C4)...
         "Tomorrow's World" maintains its academic credentials with a
         look at THE SCIENCE OF SPIDER-MAN (7pm, Wed, BBC1), including
         "a real-life gene-transferring technique that could explain
         how Peter Parker got his amazing abilities"... Michael Douglas
         finds the frustrations of even an imaginary job too much to
         bear in FALLING DOWN (10.35pm, Wed, BBC1)... as Pauline "Birds
         Of A Feather" Quirke ingeniously sidesteps being typecast as a
         middle-aged fat woman in what appears to be a sequel to that
         Liza Tarbuck drama, BEING APRIL (9pm, Thu, BBC1)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         FILM&gt;&gt; so it's not as bad as "Attack Of The Clones" - and it
         has Kirsten Dunst in it - but if Jon Katz likes it this much:
         <a href="http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/05/08/1353236">http://features.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/05/08/1353236</a>

         - then just watch out for appalling acting and dialogue in
         SPIDER-MAN ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/spiderman.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/spiderman.htm</a> :
         promotion of evolution; ghosting of [Kirsten Dunst's] anatomy
         through "wet T-shirt" clothing; corporate brutality)...
         alternatively: you wait 7 or 8 years for a Philip K Dick
         adaptation, then two come along at once - the first of which
         being expanded-from-short-feature exploding-replicants-with-
         implanted-memories "Blade Runner"-lite chase-fest IMPOSTOR
         ( <a href="http://www.capalert.com/capreports/impostor.htm">http://www.capalert.com/capreports/impostor.htm</a> : [Madeline
         Stowe] in bed in underwear; inappropriate touch; nursing a
         baby in public - though a beautiful and indeed necessary
         thing, do you do it for display as entertainment?)...
