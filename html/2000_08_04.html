</span><span class="item">         So, let's get this straight: first, Network Solutions
         changed their contracts so that they now own all the domains
         you've registered with them. Next, they withheld the release
         of unpaid domains, so that they own *those* as well - to be
         auctioned by them at some unannounced date. What's next for
         the domainitrixes? Well, how about trying to charge for
         stuff that they *don't* own? For the last few months, the
         NSI have been sending out bills for .COM, .ORG and .NET
         addresses - *even though their users have transferred the
         accounts to other registrars*. This is a little reminiscent
         of the "magazine subscription: final demand" scam that Ziff
         Davis used to put out. And even if you do pay for the
         domains, it's not as if you've got any guarantee that
         they'll work: witness the blanket denial by the G root name
         server this week that any .COM existed at all. That said, G
         isn't run by NSI, so we can't place all the blame with
         NetSol. Although if we did, we bet they'd work out a way of
         billing us for it. Ha. (Oh, and we know it's not
         authoritative any more; but it's supposed to remember
         something).

         futuristic Clive Doig-style home-made weapons systems. (Or
         is that just what they *want* you to believe?) Either way,
         it's good to see that "gentleman amateur" ethos extended to
         their website, which this week turned out - via some
         "unofficial" evaluation and research - to have what's best
         described as a "whopping great open SQL pipe" into their
         jobs database. DERA said "The developer has simply used a
         SQL like set of parameters to aid him in the parsing of the
         application parameters", but pulled the page anyway; our
         correspondent regrets not trying "INSERT INTO

         ClickMango, which disappeared with little mourning earlier
         this week. Next victim: plucky start-up Bango, which owns
         what has to be the *dumbest* idea we've heard since Real
         Names. Real Names, you may recall, was the plan to replace
         domain names with ... more names. Bango's ruse is to replace
         domain names with numbers. So the plan here is that you take
         an IP address, which is a number, then turn it into a
         domain; then turn it *back* into a number: presumably one of
         those number you can turn upside down to make a word. Ahh,

</span><span class="item_space">
</span><span class="item">         Remember back in November, when we reviewed NAPSTER and said
         it was going to *really* annoy the music industry? Well, the
         alpha of MOJO NATION is now out, and while we're not sure
         that it's going to have the same uptake as the Nap, if it
         does it'll piss off the music industry *and* every
         revenue-gathering government in the world. Currently an
         endearing mess of Python scripts and hardcore protocol
         specification, Mojo Nation uses machine resources as a
         anonymous micropayment currency to fund file storage, search
         engines and firewall proxies on a massively distributed
         network of machines. The idea here isn't to charge for MP3s
         (as some have intimated), but to charge for the cost of
         maintaining a file-sharing network, using an internal
         currency which you can top up just by offering those
         services yourself. The Mojo Nation creators, Evil Geniuses
         for A Better Tomorrow, promise to offer a real money-&gt;mojo
         tokens exchange for those too wimpy to pay in cycles: but
         what's rather more interesting is keeping all your accounts
         in pure, untrackable Mojo's, and then widening the economy
         to cover a whole range of other services. Oh, The Man is
         going to *love* this.

         extreme reality-com TOM GREEN'S CANCER SPECIAL (10pm, Fri,
         MTV), followed by two THE BESTS OF TOM GREEN (10pm, Sat; 9pm,
         Sun), the latter as lead-ins to the ominously titled "Richard
         Blackwood's Comedy Weekend"... if they wanted to avoid
         unflattering comparisons with "Father Ted", why did the makers
         of THE FITZ (9.30pm, Fri; 11.10pm, Sun; BBC2) fill it with
         goofy Oirish stereotypes?... and, clearly being groomed for
         that prestigious Star Trek repeat slot, it's now possible to
         catch THE FRESH PRINCE OF BEL AIR three times a week on BBC2
         alone (6.45pm, Fri; 11am, Sun; Mon, 6.20pm)... ITV heads off
         BBC2's simultaneous tribute to Lauren Bacall with a triple
         bill of Peter Sellers programming, starting with one of his
         hilarious "Indian" character-slapsticks THE PARTY (2.15pm,

         least one of her subjects... SECRETS OF THE DEAD (9pm, Mon,

         may have been caused by - ergot wheat poisoning!... we refer
         you to NTK 1999-05-14 for our definitive gag about fighting-
         Kylie beat-em-up STREET FIGHTER (9pm, Tue, C5)... still plenty
         of episodes left of SNL-alumnus vehicle NORM (2.10am, Tue, C4)
         - in the ongoing absence of Seinfeld and Sanders, easily
         terrestrial's cruellest sitcom... and, finally, Jeremy

         indeed, among THE TOUGHEST JOBS IN BRITAIN (8pm, Thu, BBC1)...

</span><span class="geekmedia">         INTERNECINE NATHANIC INFIGHTING&gt;&gt; the confession of CHARLIE
         "TVGoHome" BROOKER (currently tipped as the next "Tapehead"
         in the "Guardian Guide") to being the prototypical "Nathan
         Barley" [NTK 2000-07-21] has prompted an unexpected number
         of Spartacus-style counter-claims. "I am the real Nathan
         Barley" proclaimed JAMIE KING on his <a href="http://www.jamie.com/">http://www.jamie.com/</a>
         page, after being nominated in NTK 2000-06-09; within weeks,
         he'd got back in touch with us, gobsmacked that this had led
         to his receiving "regular abuse mail" from "various parts of
         the West London noomedia fraternity looking, maybe, to
         transfer a little of their Nathanness on to me". "I can't
         believe anyone would happily compare themselves to Nathen
         fucking Barley," begins one. "You KNOW you're going to get
         hate mail [...] soulless public school mockney talentless
         smartarse gadget- obsessed tosser fuckwit [...] piss off
         back to obscurity [...]" "This, from someone called
         Tristan!", Jamie seethes, before launching his own polite
         little tirade against "public school people in West
         London"... meanwhile, multiplying the unwitting Nathanity
         ironies still further, ex-NTK music columnist JAMES
         "Habitus" FLINT reveals privileged details about his new
         novel (which due to market pressures will not now be called
         "Habitum"). While writing, he came across TVGoHome, and "in
         partic., the wonderful Nathan Barlow [sic]", a character
         which he would like to licence to appear in his new book, as
         "a young web journalist who has telephone sex with one of my
         characters before bounding off to eagerly interview
         another"... yes, the Nathan-on-Nathan action is definitely
         hotting up, and will hopefully now be recognised with a
         special "Nathano di tutti Nathani" (lit: the "Nathan's
         Nathan") award at next year's Milia show in Cannes - so if
         you stumble across the webpage of a Nathan Barley-style
         "Cunt" (or if, perhaps you are one!) do get in touch with us
         soon, using the subject line "I've stumbled across the
         webpage of a Nathan Barley-style 'Cunt' (or, perhaps, I am
